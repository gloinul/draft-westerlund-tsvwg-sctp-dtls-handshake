  Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) based key-management of the
         Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) DTLS Chunk
           draft-westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-handshake-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a key-management solution based on Datagram
   Transport Layer Security 1.3 (DTLS) to protect the content of Stream
   Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) packets using the packet
   protection framework provided by the SCTP DTLS chunk.  The
   combination provides encryption, source authentication, integrity and
   replay protection for the SCTP association with in-band DTLS based
   key-management and mutual authentication of the peers.  The
   specification is enabling very long-lived sessions of weeks and
   months and supports mutual re-authentication and rekeying with
   ephemeral key exchange.  The key-management solution does not require
   any additional defined features or implementation support beyond core
   DTLS 1.3.  This is intended as an replacement to using DTLS/SCTP
   (RFC6083) and SCTP-AUTH (RFC4895).

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   This document describes the usage of the Datagram Transport Layer
   Security version 1.3 (DTLS) [RFC9147] protocol for key-managment of
   the SCTP DTLS Chunk packet protection
   [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk] securing Stream Control
   Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC9260].  This combination of
   specification is intended as an replacement to DTLS/SCTP [RFC6083]
   and usage of SCTP-AUTH [RFC4895].  The combination of SCTP DTLS Chunk
   and the key-management defined in this document we refer to as DTLS
   in SCTP.

   DTLS in SCTP provides mutual authentication of endpoints, data
   confidentiality, data origin authentication, data integrity
   protection, and data replay protection of SCTP packets.  Ensuring
   these security services to the application and its upper layer
   protocol over SCTP.  Thus, it allows client/server applications to
   communicate in a way that is designed with communications privacy and
   preventing eavesdropping and detect tampering or message forgery.

   Applications using DTLS in SCTP can use all currently existing
   transport features provided by SCTP and its extensions, in some cases
   with some limitations, as specified in
   [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].  DTLS in SCTP supports:

   *  preservation of message boundaries.

   *  no limitation on number of unidirectional and bidirectional
      streams.

   *  ordered and unordered delivery of SCTP user messages.

   *  the partial reliability extension as defined in [RFC3758].

   *  multi-homing of the SCTP association per [RFC9260].

   *  the dynamic address reconfiguration extension as defined in
      [RFC5061] (Limitations apply).

   *  User messages of any size.

   *  SCTP Packets with a protected set of chunks up to a size of 2^14
      (16384) bytes.

   The main benefit of this key-management solution over the solution
   proposed by the WG is that this does not require any extensions to
   DTLS 1.3 to be implemented.  It soley relies on the core DTLS
   handshake to do mutual authentication, a create a main secret, and
   then relies on the TLS exporter to export necessary secrets for the
   DTLS Chunk.

1.2.  Protocol Overview

   DTLS in SCTP is a key management specification for the SCTP DTLS 1.3
   chunk [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk] that together utilizes
   DTLS 1.3 for the security functions like key exchange,
   authentication, encryption, integrity protection, and replay
   protection.  All key management message exchange happens inband over
   the SCTP assocation.

   In this document we use the terms DTLS Key context for indicating the
   pair of keys, derived from a DTLS connection, and all relevant data
   that needs to be provided to the SCTP DTLS Chunk Protection Operator
   for DTLS encryption and decryption.  DTLS Key context includes Keys
   for sending and receiving, replay window, last used sequence number.
   Each DTLS key context is associated with a four value tuple
   identifying the context, consisting of SCTP Association, the restart
   indicator, the DTLS Connection ID (if used), an the DTLS epoch.

   The basic functionalities and how things are related is described
   below.

   The process starts with a SCTP association where DTLS 1.3 Chunk usage
   has been negotiated and this key-managmenet method has been agreed in
   the SCTP INIT and INIT-ACK.  To initilize and authenticate the peer
   the DTLS handshake is exchanged as SCTP user messages with the DTLS
   Chunk Key-Management Messages PPID (see section 10.6 of
   [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk]) until an initial DTLS
   connection has been established.  If the DTLS handshake fails, the
   SCTP association is aborted.  With succesful handshake and
   authentication of the peer the key material exported from the DTLS
   connection and configured for the DTLS 1.3 chunk.  From that point
   until SCTP association termination the DTLS chunk will protect the
   SCTP packets.  When the DTLS connection has been established and the
   DTLS Chunk configured with DTLS Key context the PVALID message is
   exchanged to verify that no downgrade attack between any offered
   protection solutions has occurred.  To prevent manipulation, the
   PVALID message are sent as SCTP user messages (using DATA chunks)
   encapsulated in DTLS chunks.

   Assuming that the PVALID validation is successful the SCTP
   association is established and the Upper Layer Protocol (ULP) can
   start sending messages over the SCTP association.  All chunks are
   protected by encapsulating them in DTLS chunks as defined in
   [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].  Using the current DTLS Key
   context the DTLS Chunk Protection operator protects the plain text,
   which is all chunks to be sent in one SCTP packet, producing a DTLS
   Record that is encapsualted in the DTLS chunk and then transmitted as
   a SCTP packet with a common header.

   The DTLS Chunk specifies that in the receiving SCTP endpoint each
   incoming SCTP packet on any of its interfaces and ports are matched
   to the SCTP association based on ports and VTAG in the common header.
   Using the indicated DTLS Key context(s) for that SCTP association the
   content of the DTLS chunk is attempted to be processed, including
   replay protection, decryption, and integrity checking.  And if
   decryption and integrity verification was successful the produced
   plain text of one or more SCTP chunks are provided for normal SCTP
   processing in the identified SCTP association along with associated
   per-packet meta data such as path received on, original packet size,
   and ECN bits.

   When mutual re-authentication or rekeying is needed or desired by
   either endpoint a new DTLS connection handshake is performed between
   the SCTP endpoints and a new DTLS Key context is created.  When the
   handshake has completed the DTLS in SCTP implementation can simply
   switch to use the new DTLS Key contexts in the DTLS chunk.  All
   rekeying will be using ephemeral key exchange and shall not use the
   DTLS Key-Update mechanism to avoid confusion about the properties of
   the DTLS Key Contexts for the DTLS chunk.  After a short while (no
   longer than 2 min) to enable any outstanding packets to drain from
   the network path between the endpoints, the old key-management DTLS
   connection is closed and that signal that the corresponding key
   context can be deleted from the DTLS chunk's key store.

   The DTLS connection may send alerts, handshake messages, or other
   non-application data to its peer at any point in time.  All DTLS
   message will be sent by means of SCTP user messages with the DTLS
   Chunk Key-Management Messages PPID as specified in
   [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].  However, only the DTLS
   close_notify is expected to be used after the handshake has been
   completed in this solution.

1.3.  Properties of DTLS in SCTP

   DTLS in SCTP (as the combination of the DTLS chunk and the in-band
   authentication and key-management using DTLS handshakes defined in
   this document) has a number of properties that are attractive.

   *  Provides confidentiality, integrity protection, and source
      authentication for each SCTP packet.

   *  Provides replay protection on SCTP packet level preventing
      malicious replay attacks on SCTP, both protecting the data as well
      as the SCTP functions themselves.

   *  Provides mutual authentication of the endpoints based on any
      authentication mechanism supported by DTLS.

   *  Uses parallel DTLS connections to enable mutual re-authentication
      and rekeying with ephemeral key-exchange.  Thus, enabling SCTP
      association lifetimes without known limitations and without
      needing to drain the SCTP association.

   *  Uses core of DTLS as it is and updates and fixes to DTLS security
      properties; can be implemented without further changes to this
      specification.

   *  No reliance on DTLS implementation used for key-management having
      to support any features beyond core DTLS specification and the TLS
      exporter.

   *  Secures all SCTP packets exchanged after SCTP association has
      reached the established state and the initial key-exchange has
      completed.  Making targeted attacks against the SCTP protocol and
      implementation much harder.

   *  DTLS in SCTP results in no limitations on user message
      transmission or message sizes, those properties are the same as
      for an unprotected SCTP association.

   *  Limited overhead on a per packet basis, with 4 bytes for the DTLS
      chunk plus the DTLS record overhead.  The DTLS overhead is
      dependent on the DTLS version and cipher suit.

   *  Support of SCTP packet plain text payload sizes up to 2^14 bytes.

1.4.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms:

   Association:  An SCTP association.

   Connection:  A DTLS connection.

   DTLS Key context:  Keys, derived from a DTLS connection, and all
      relevant data that needs to be provided to the SCTP DTLS Chunk.
      Each DTLS key context is associated with a four value tuple
      identifying the context, consisting of SCTP Association, the
      restart indicator, the DTLS Connection ID (if used), an the DTLS
      epoch

   Restart DTLS Key context:  A DTLS Key context to be used for an SCTP
      Association Restart

   Stream:  A unidirectional stream of an SCTP association.  It is
      uniquely identified by a stream identifier.

2.  DTLS usage of DTLS Chunk

   DTLS in SCTP uses the DTLS chunk as specified in
   [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].  The chunk if just repeated
   here for the reader's convience.

                       Figure 2: DTLS Chunk Structure

   Type: 8 bits  The Chunk Type indicate that this is the DTLS chunk.

   reserved: 7 bits  Reserved bits for future use.  Sender MUST set
      these bits to 0 and MUST be ignored on reception.

   R: 1 bit (boolean)  Restart indicator.  If this bit is set this DTLS
      chunk is protected with by an Restart DTLS Key context.

   Chunk Length: 16 bits (unsigned integer)  This value holds the length
      of the Payload in bytes plus 4.

   Payload: variable length  This holds the encrypted data as one DTLS
      1.3 Record [RFC9147].

   Padding: 0, 8, 16, or 24 bits  To ensure the Chunk is whole 32-bit
      words long.

3.  DTLS messages over SCTP User Messages

   DTLS messages for the Handshake DTLS connection, i.e. that are not
   DTLS records containing protected SCTP chunk payloads, will be sent
   as SCTP user messages using the format defined below.  A DTLS
   handshake message may be fragmented by DTLS to a set of DTLS records
   of a maximum configured fragment size.  Each DTLS message fragment is
   sent as a SCTP user message on the same stream where each message is
   configured for reliable and in-order delivery with the PPID set to
   DTLS Chunk Key-Management Messages
   [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].  These user messages MAY
   contain one or more DTLS records.  The SCTP stream ID used MAY be any
   stream ID that the ULP alreay uses, and if not know Stream 0.  Note
   that all fragments of a handshake message MUST be sent with the same
   stream ID to ensure the in-order delivery.

                   Figure 3: DTLS User Message Structure

   Reserved: 6 bits  Each bit MUST be set to zero (0) on transmission
      and MUST be ignored on reception.  These bits MAY in the future be
      assigned a meaning when set to one (1).

   DCI: DTLS Connection Index 2 bits (unsigned integer)  DTLS Connection
      Index is the lower two bits of an DTLS Connection Index counter
      which corresponds to the epoch used in the SCTP DTLS Chunk.  This
      is a counter implemented in DTLS in SCTP that is used to identify
      which DTLS connection instance that is capable of processing the
      DTLS message over an user message.  This index is recommended to
      be the lower part of a 64-bit unsigned integer variable as this is
      how DTLS epoch counter is defined.  DCI is unrelated to the DTLS
      Connection ID [RFC9147].  The counters initial value SHALL be
      three (3).

   DTLS Message: variable length  One or more DTLS records.  In cases
      more than one DTLS record is included all DTLS records except the
      last MUST include a length field.  Note that this matches what is
      specified in DTLS 1.3 [RFC9147] will always include the length
      field in each record.

4.  DTLS Chunk Integration

   The [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk] contains a high-level
   description of the basic DTLS in SCTP architecture, this section
   deals with details related to the DTLS 1.3 inband key-establishment
   integration with SCTP.

4.1.  State Machine

   DTLS in SCTP uses inband key-establishment, thus the DTLS handshake
   establishes shared keys with the remote peer.  As soon as the SCTP
   State Machine enters PROTECTION INITILIZATION state, DTLS in SCTP is
   responsible for progressing to the PROTECTED state when DTLS
   handshake has completed.

4.1.1.  PROTECTION INITILIZATION state

   When entering PROTECTION INITILIZATION state, DTLS will start the
   handshake according to Section 6.3.

   When a successful handshake has been completed, the Traffic DTLS Key
   Context and the Restart DTLS Key Context will be created by deriving
   the keys from the DTLS connection.  At that point the DTLS chunk
   Handler will move to the VALIDATION state and perform validation and
   then move SCTP State Machine into PROTECTED state.

4.1.2.  PROTECTED state

   In the PROTECTED state the currently active DTLS connection is used
   for protection operation of the payload of SCTP chunks in each packet
   per below specification.  When necessary to meet requirements on key
   life time or periodic re-authentication of the peer and establishment
   of new forward secrecy keys, the existing DTLS 1.3 connection is
   being replaced with a new one by first opening a new parallel DTLS
   connection as further specified in Section 7 and then close the old
   DTLS connection and remove the old DTLS Key context.

4.1.3.  SHUTDOWN states

   When the SCTP association leaves the ESTABLISHED state per [RFC9260]
   to be shutdown the DTLS connection is kept and continues to protect
   the SCTP packet payloads through the shutdown process.

   When the association reaches the CLOSED state as part of the SCTP
   association closing process all DTLS connections existing (traffic
   and restart) for this association are terminated without further
   transmissions, i.e. DTLS close_notify is not transmitted.

4.2.  DTLS Connection Handling

   It's up to DTLS key-establishment function to manage the DTLS
   connections and their related DTLS Key context in the DTLS chunk.

4.2.1.  Add a New DTLS Connection

   Either peer can add a new DTLS connection to the SCTP association at
   any time, but no more than 2 DTLS connections can exist at the same
   time.  Details of the handshake are described in Section 6.3.

   As either endpoint can initiate a DTLS handshake at the same time,
   either endpoint may receive a DTLS ClientHello message when it has
   sent its own ClientHello.  In this case the ClientHello from the
   endpoint that had the DTLS Client role in the establishment of the
   previous DTLS connection shall be continued to be processed and the
   other dropped.

   When the handshake has been completed successfully, the new DTLS Key
   contexts are established by exporting keys and installing the in the
   DTLS Chunk, and the new DTLS Key context are immediately started to
   be used.  If the handshake is not completed successfully, a new DTLS
   handshake attempt will be tried using the same DCI.

4.2.2.  Remove an existing DTLS Connection

   A DTLS connection is removed when a newer DTLS connection is in use.
   It is RECOMMENDED to not initiate removal until at least one SCTP
   packet protected by the new DTLS Key Context has been received, and
   any transmitted packets protected using the new DTLS Key Context has
   been acknowledge, alternatively one Maximum Segment Lifetime (120
   seconds) has passed since the last SCTP packet protected by the old
   DTLS connection was transmitted.

   Either peers can initialize the removal of a DTLS connection from the
   current SCTP association when needed when a new have been
   established.  The closing of the DTLS connection when the SCTP
   association is in PROTECTED and ESTABLISHED state is done by having
   the DTLS connection send a DTLS close_notify.  When the DTLS closure
   of a DTLS connection is completed, the related DTLS Key Contexts
   (Traffic and Restart) in the DTLS chunk are released.

4.2.3.  Considerations about removal of DTLS Connections

   Removal of a DTLS connection may happen under circumstances as
   described above in Section 4.2.2 in different states of the
   Association.  This section describes how the implementation should
   take care of the DTLS connection removal in details.

   The initial DTLS connection exists as soon as Association reaches the
   PROTECTED state.  As long as one DTLS connection only exists, that
   DTLS connection SHALL NOT be removed as it won't be possible for the
   Association to proceed further.

   In general a DTLS connection can be removed when there's another
   active DTLS connection with valid DTLS Key Contexts that can be used
   for negotiating further key-management DTLS 1.3 connections.  In case
   the DTLS connection is removed and no useable DTLS Key Context exist
   for key-managemetn DTLS 1.3 negotiation, the Association SHALL be
   ABORTED.

   It is up to the implementation to guarantee that a DTLS Key Context
   exists all the time, for avoiding that undesired DTLS connection
   closure causes the Association abortion.

4.3.  DTLS Key Update

   DTLS Key Update MUST NOT be used.  DTLS Key Context replacemente MUST
   be used instead, by means creating a new DTLS connection as specified
   in Section 7, deriving the new Traffic DTLS Key Context, the new
   Restart DTLS Key Context and then closing the old DTLS connection.

4.4.  Error Cases

   As DTLS has its own error reporting mechanism by exchanging DTLS
   alert messages no new DTLS related cause codes are defined to use the
   error handling defined in [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].

   When Handshake DTLS connection encounters an error it may report that
   issue using DTLS alert message to its peer by putting the created
   DTLS record in a SCTP user message (Section 3) with the Handshake
   PPID.  This is independent of what to do in relation to the SCTP
   association.  Depending on the severance of the error different paths
   can be the result:

   However, as there is not expected that the key-management DTLS
   connection will at all have any activity between completing the
   handshake, and the DTLS connection closing, there is unlikely that
   any error will occurr.

5.  DTLS Considerations

5.1.  Version of DTLS

   This document defines the usage of DTLS 1.3 [RFC9147].  Earlier
   versions of DTLS MUST NOT be used (see [RFC8996]).  It is expected
   that DTLS in SCTP as described in this document will work with future
   versions of DTLS.

   Only one version of DTLS MUST be used during the lifetime of an SCTP
   Association, meaning that the procedure for replacing the DTLS
   version in use requires the existing SCTP Association to be
   terminated and a new SCTP Association with the desired DTLS version
   to be instantiated.

5.2.  Configuration of Key-Management DTLS

5.2.1.  General

   The DTLS Connection ID SHOULD NOT be used in the Key-Managment DTLS
   Connection avoiding overhead and addition implementation requirements
   on DTLS implementation.

   The DTLS record length field is normally not needed as the DTLS Chunk
   provides a length field unless multiple records are put in same DTLS
   chunk payload or user message.  If multiple DTLS records are included
   in one DTLS chunk payload or user message the DTLS record length
   field MUST be present in all but the last.

   DTLS record replay detection MUST be used.

   Sequence number size can be adapted based on how quickly it wraps.

   Many of the TLS registries have a "Recommended" column.  Parameters
   not marked as "Y" are NOT RECOMMENDED to support.  Non-AEAD cipher
   suites or cipher suites without confidentiality MUST NOT be
   supported.  Cipher suites and parameters that do not provide
   ephemeral key-exchange MUST NOT be supported.

   The Cipher suits negotiated in the Key-Management DTLS Connection
   SHALL only include those supported by the DTLS Chunk.  The DTLS Chunk
   is expected to have an API capability to determine the Cipher Suit
   Capabilities, see Abstract API in Section 10.1 of
   [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].

5.2.2.  Authentication and Policy Decisions

   DTLS in SCTP MUST be mutually authenticated.  Authentication is the
   process of establishing the identity of a user or system and
   verifying that the identity is valid.  DTLS only provides proof of
   possession of a key.  DTLS in SCTP MUST perform identity
   authentication.  It is RECOMMENDED that DTLS in SCTP is used with
   certificate-based authentication.

   When certificates are used the application using DTLS in SCTP is
   responsible for certificate policies, certificate chain validation,
   and identity authentication (HTTPS does for example match the
   hostname with a subjectAltName of type dNSName).  The application
   using DTLS in SCTP defines what the identity is and how it is encoded
   and the client and server MUST use the same identity format.
   Guidance on server certificate validation can be found in
   [I-D.ietf-uta-rfc6125bis].  DTLS in SCTP enables periodic transfer of
   mutual revocation information (OSCP stapling) every time a new
   parallel connection is set up.  All security decisions MUST be based
   on the peer's authenticated identity, not on its transport layer
   identity.

   It is possible to authenticate DTLS endpoints based on IP addresses
   in certificates.  SCTP associations can use multiple IP addresses per
   SCTP endpoint.  Therefore, it is possible that DTLS records will be
   sent from a different source IP address or to a different destination
   IP address than that originally authenticated.  This is not a problem
   provided that no security decisions are made based on the source or
   destination IP addresses.

5.2.3.  New Connections

   Implementations MUST set up a new DTLS connection using a full
   handshake before any of the certificates expire.  It is RECOMMENDED
   that all negotiated and exchanged parameters are the same except for
   the timestamps in the certificates.  Clients and servers MUST NOT
   accept a change of identity during the setup of a new connections,
   but MAY accept negotiation of stronger algorithms and security
   parameters, which might be motivated by new attacks.

   Allowing new connections can enable denial-of-service attacks.  The
   endpoints MUST limit the number of simultaneous connections to two.

   To force attackers to do dynamic key exfiltration and limit the
   amount of compromised data due to key compromise, implementations
   MUST have policies for how often to set up new connections with
   ephemeral key exchange such as ECDHE.  Implementations SHOULD set up
   new connections frequently to force attackers to dynamic key
   extraction.  E.g., at least every hour and every 100 GB of data which
   is a common policy for IPsec [ANSSI-DAT-NT-003].  See
   [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis] for a more detailed discussion on key
   compromise and key exfiltration in (D)TLS.  As recommended in
   [KTH-NCSA], resumption can be used to chain the connections,
   increasing security by forcing an adversary to break them in
   sequence.

   For many DTLS in SCTP deployments the SCTP association is expected to
   have a very long lifetime of months or even years.  For associations
   with such long lifetimes there is a need to frequently re-
   authenticate both client and server by setting up a new connection
   using a full handshake.  TLS Certificate lifetimes significantly
   shorter than a year are common which is shorter than many expected
   SCTP associations protected by DTLS in SCTP.

5.2.4.  DTLS 1.3

   DTLS 1.3 is used instead of DTLS 1.2 being a newer protocol that
   addresses known vulnerabilities and only defines strong algorithms
   without known major weaknesses at the time of publication.

   DTLS 1.3 requires rekeying before algorithm specific AEAD limits have
   been reached.  Implementations setup a new DTLS connection to handle
   the need for new keys, alternatively terminate the SCTP Assocation.

   In DTLS 1.3 any number of tickets can be issued in a connection and
   the tickets can be used for resumption as long as they are valid,
   which is up to seven days.  The nodes in a resumed connection have
   the same roles (client or server) as in the connection where the
   ticket was issued.  Resumption can have significant latency benefits
   for quickly restarting a broken DTLS/SCTP association.  If tickets
   and resumption are used it is enough to issue a single ticket per
   connection.

   The PSK key exchange mode : psk_ke MUST NOT be used as it does not
   provide ephemeral key exchange.

6.  Establishing DTLS in SCTP

   This section specifies how DTLS in SCTP is established using Key-
   Management DTLS Connections and the DTLS Chunk
   [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].

   A DTLS in SCTP Association is built up with a Key-Management DTLS
   connection, from that DTLS connection Traffic DTLS Key Context and
   Restart DTLS Key Context are derived and the configures the DTLS
   Context.

   The Key-Management DTLS connection is established as part of extra
   procedures for the DTLS chunk initial handshake (see Section 6.3.1).

6.1.  DTLS Key Context derivation

   This section describes how DTLS Key Contexts are derived from the
   DTLS handshake using the TLS Exporter as defined by [RFC9147].  The
   TLS exporter label specifications below is following [RFC5705].

   There are two sets of keys one for traffic and one for restart.  Each
   set consists of one client and one server side write key.  The client
   and server roles are here in relation to key-management DTLS session
   roles.  So the DTLS Client will install the key derived using the
   EXPORTER_DTLS_IN_SCTP_TRAFFIC_CLIENT label as its write key for the
   traffic context, and use the EXPORTER_DTLS_IN_SCTP_TRAFFIC_SERVER as
   its traffic DTLS context read key.  Correspondlingly the
   EXPORTER_DTLS_IN_SCTP_RESTART_CLIENT is used to export the key used
   by the endpoint that acted as DTLS Client as write key for the
   restart DTLS key context.  And the
   EXPORTER_DTLS_IN_SCTP_RESTART_SERVER as the DTLS client's read key
   for the restart DTLS Key Context.

   The following labels are defined:

   *  EXPORTER_DTLS_IN_SCTP_TRAFFIC_CLIENT

   *  EXPORTER_DTLS_IN_SCTP_TRAFFIC_SERVER

   *  EXPORTER_DTLS_IN_SCTP_RESTART_CLIENT

   *  EXPORTER_DTLS_IN_SCTP_RESTART_SERVER

   To ensure that downgrade attack on the protection solution offered is
   not is possible the context used will be the full sequence of
   Protection Solution Identiers as include in the DTLS 1.3 Chunk
   Protected Association (Section 4.1 of
   [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk]) sent by the SCTP assocation
   initiator.  Thus, any downgrade attack on this will result in a
   missmatch in produced keys as the initiator will use what it actually
   offered and the responder a truncated or modified sequence.

   The length of the exported key material depends on the need for the
   negotiatated cipher suit for the protection.

6.2.  Protection Solution Validations

   TO BE WRITTEN

6.3.  DTLS Handshake

6.3.1.  Handshake of initial DTLS connection

   The handshake of the initial DTLS connection is part of the DTLS in
   SCTP Association initialization.  The initialization is split in
   three distinct phases:

   *  SCTP Handshake

   *  DTLS Handshake

   *  Validation

   Moving towards next phase is possible only when the previous phase
   handshake is completed.

   SCTP Handshake is strictly compliant to [RFC9260].  The DTLS 1.3
   Chunk Protected Association parameter (Section 4.1 of
   [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk]) is included containing the
   Protection Solution identifier (See Section 9.1) for this documents
   key-management at a suitable preference position depending on local
   policy.  And in case this key-management solution is the most
   preferred then the process continues as stated below.

   As soon the SCTP Association has entered the SCTP state PROTECTION
   INITILIZATION as defined by [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk]
   the DTLS handshake procedure is initiated by the endpoint that has
   initiated the SCTP association.

   The DTLS endpoint will send the DTLS message in one or more SCTP user
   message depending if the DTLS endpoint fragments the message or not
   Section 3.  The DTLS instance SHOULD NOT use DTLS retransmission to
   repair any packet losses of handshake message fragment.  Note: If the
   DTLS implementation supports configuring a MTU larger than the actual
   IP MTU it MAY be used as SCTP provides reliability and fragmentation.

   If the DTLS handshake is successful in establishing a security
   context to protect further communication and the peer identity is
   accepted then generate the Traffic DTLS Key Context and Restart DTLS
   Key Context as specified in Section 6.1.

   The DTLS Key Contexts are installed for the DTLS chunk.  When this
   has been completed the implementation performs validation by
   exchanging PVALID messages per Section 6.2.

   Once the Association has been validated, then the SCTP association is
   informed that it can move to the PROTECTED state.

   If the DTLS handshake failed the SCTP association SHALL be aborted
   and an ERROR chunk with the Error in Protection error cause, with the
   appropriate extra error causes is generated, the right selection of
   "Error During Protection Handshake" or "Timeout During Protection
   Handshake or Validation".

    Initiator                                     Responder

               Figure 4: Handshake of initial DTLS connection

   The Figure 4 shows a successfull handshake and highlits the different
   parts of the setup.  DTLS handshake messages are transported by means
   of DATA Chunks with the DTLS Chunk Key-Management Messages PPID.

6.3.2.  Handshake of further DTLS connections

   When the SCTP Association has entered the PROTECTED state, each of
   the endpoint can initiate a DTLS handshake for rekeying when
   necessary.

   The DTLS endpoint will if necessary fragment the handshake into
   multiple records.  Each DTLS handshake message fragment is sent as a
   SCTP user message Section 3.  The DTLS instance SHOULD NOT use DTLS
   retransmission to repair any packet losses of handshake message
   fragment.  Note: If the DTLS implementation support configuring a MTU
   larger than the actual IP MTU it could be used as SCTP provides
   reliability and fragmentation.

   If the DTLS handshake failed the SCTP association SHALL generate an
   ERROR chunk with the Error in Protection error cause, with extra
   error causes "Error During Protection Handshake".

          Initiator                                     Responder

              |                                             |

               Figure 5: Handshake of further DTLS connection

   The Figure 5 shows a successfull handshake of a further DTLS
   connection.  Such connections can be initiated by any of the peers.
   Same as during the initial handshake, DTLS handshake messages are
   transported by means of DATA chunks with the DTLS Chunk Key-
   Management Messages PPID.

6.4.  SCTP Association Restart

   In order to achieve an Association Restart as described in
   [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk], a Restart DTLS Key Context
   dedicated to Restart SHALL exist and be available.  Furthermore, both
   peers SHALL have safely stored both the current Restart DTLS Key
   Context.  Here we assume that Restart DTLS Key Context is maintained
   across the events leading to SCTP Restart request.

6.4.1.  Installation of initial Restart DTLS Key Context

   As soon as the Association has reached the PROTECTED INITILIZATION
   state, after the Traffic DTLS Key context have been installed a
   Restart DTLS Key Context SHALL be derived and then installed.

   It MAY exist a short time gap where the Association has entered in
   PROTECTED state but no Restart DTLS Key Context has been installed
   yet.  If a SCTP Restart procedure will be initiated during that time,
   it will fail and the Association will also fail.  However, this is
   unlikely as the restart Init will be sent multiple times following a
   expontial back-off timer and in that time the Restart DTLS Key
   Context is expected to be in place.

   Once installed, no traffic will be sent over the Restart DTLS Key
   Context so that both endpoints will have a known DTLS context state,
   i.e. the Sequence number and replay window are both just initilized
   to default values for the epoch=3.

6.4.2.  Installation of Restart DTLS Key Context for further DTLS
        Connections

   As each subsequent Key-Management DTLS connection complete the DTLS
   handshake and the Traffic DTLS Key context has been derived and
   installed also the Restart DTLS Key context SHALL be installed.  The
   closing of the previous DTLS connection SHALL NOT be initiated or
   completed until the Restart DTLS Key Context is in place.

6.4.3.  SCTP Association Restart Procedure

   The DTLS in SCTP Association Restart is meant to preserve the
   security characteristics.

   In order the Association Restart to proceed both Initiator and
   Responder SHALL use the same Restart DTLS Key Context for COOKIE-
   ECHO/COOKIE-ACK handshake, that implies that the Initiator must
   preserve the Restart DTLS Key Context and that the Responder SHALL
   NOT change the Restart DTLS Key Context during the Restart procedure.

            Figure 6: SCTP Restart sequence for DTLS in SCTP

   The Figure 6 shows a successfull SCTP Association Restart.

   From procedure viewpoint the sequence is the following:

   *  Initiator sends INIT (VTag=0), Responder replies INIT-ACK both
      encrypted using Restart DTLS Key Context

   *  Initiator sends COOKIE-ECHO using DTLS CHUNK encrypted with the
      Key tied to the Restart DTLS Key Context

   *  Responder replies with COOKIE-ACK using DTLS CHUNK encrypted with
      the to the Restart DTLS Key Context

   *  Initiator sends handshakes for new Traffic DTLS connnection as
      well as new Restart DTLS connection.

   *  The SCTP Association goes into Established state and jumps
      directly to PROTECTED state, and the ULP can resume communication
      protected using the Restart DTLS Key Context.

   *  A new key-management DTLS handshake is initiated as soon as
      PROTECTED state has been reached.  When the Key-management DTLS
      connection has been completed, new Traffic and Restart DTLS Key
      Contexts are derived and installed using Epoch=3.  The new Traffic
      DTLS Key Context is being used for traffic as soon as the context
      have been installed.  When Traffic Key Context has been installed
      the new Restart DTLS Key Context for epoch=3 are installed.

   User Data for any ULP traffic MAY be initiated immediately after
   COOKIE-ECHO/COOKIE-ACK handshake using the current Restart DTLS Key
   Context, that is even before a new Traffic DTLS Key Context or a
   Restart DTLS Key Context have been derived.  If a problem occurs
   before the new Restart DTLS Key Context has been installed, the
   Association cannot be Restarted, thus it's RECOMMENDED the new
   Restart DTLS Key Context to be installed as early as possible.

   Note that, different than the initial Association establishment, the
   ULP traffic is permitted immediately after the COOKIE-ECHO/COOKIE-ACK
   handshake, the reason is that the validation has already been
   performed prior to the restart DTLS Key Context was created.

7.  Parallel DTLS Rekeying

   Rekeying in this specification is implemented by replacing the DTLS
   connection getting old with a new one by first creating the new DTLS
   connection, derive the new DTLS Key contexts, start using it, then
   closing the old one.

7.1.  Criteria for Rekeying

   The criteria for rekeying may vary depending on the ULP requirement
   on security properties, chosen cipher suits etc.  Therefore it is
   assumed that the implementation will be configurable by the ULP to
   meet its demand.

   Likely criteria to impact the need for rekeying through the usage of
   new DTLS connection are:

   *  Time duration since last authentication of the peer

   *  Amount of data transferred since last forward secrecy preserving
      rekeying

   *  The cipher suit's maximum key usage being reached.

7.2.  Procedure for Rekeying

   This specification allows up to 2 DTLS connection to be active at the
   same time for the current SCTP Association.  The following state
   machine applies.

           +---------+
+--------->|  YOUNG  |  There's only one
|          +----+----+  DTLS connection until
|               |       aging criteria are met
|               |
|        AGING  |  REMOTE AGING
|               V
|          +---------+
|          |  AGED   |  When in AGED state a
|          +----+----+  new DTLS connection
|               |       is added and deriving new Traffic DTLS Key Context
|      NEW DTLS |       as well as a new Restart DTLS Key Context
|               |
|               |
|               V
|          +---------+
|          |   OLD   |  In OLD state there
|          +----+----+  are 2 active DTLS connections
|               |       Traffic is switched to the new Traffic DTLS Key Context
|      SWITCH   |
|               V
|          +---------+
|          |  DRAIN  |  The aged DTLS connection
|          +----+----+  is drained before being ready
|               |       to be closed
|               |
|       DRAINED | DTLS close_notify
|               V
|          +---------+
|          |  DEAD   |  In DEAD state the aged
|          +----+----+  connection is closed
|               |
|      REMOVED  |
+---------------+

                 Figure 7: State Diagram for Rekeying

   Trigger for rekeying can either be a local AGING event, triggered by
   the DTLS connection meeting the criteria for rekeying, or a REMOTE
   AGING event, triggered by receiving a DTLS Connection handshake on
   the DTLS Connection Index (next value) that would be used for new
   DTLS connection.  In such case a new DTLS connection shall be added
   according to Section 4.2.1.

   As soon as the new DTLS connection completes handshaking, and the
   Traffic and Restart DTLS Key Contexts have been derived and
   installed, the protection of the SCTP packets is moved from the old
   Traffic DTLS Key Context, then the procedure for closing the old DTLS
   connection is initiated, see Section 4.2.2.

7.3.  Race Condition in Rekeying

   A race condition may happen when both peer experience local AGING
   event at the same time and start creation of a new DTLS connection.

   The race condition is solved as specified in Section 4.2.1.

8.  Security Considerations

8.1.  General

   The security considerations given in [RFC9147], [RFC6347], and
   [RFC9260] also apply to this document.  BCP 195 [RFC9325] [RFC8996]
   provides recommendations and requirements for improving the security
   of deployed services that use DTLS.  BCP 195 MUST be followed which
   implies that DTLS 1.0 SHALL NOT be supported and are therefore not
   defined.

8.2.  Privacy Considerations

   Although DTLS in SCTP provides privacy for the actual user message as
   well as almost all chunks, some fields are not confidentiality
   protected.  In addition to the DTLS record header, the SCTP common
   header and the DTLS chunk header are not confidentiality protected.
   An attacker can correlate DTLS connections over the same SCTP
   association using the SCTP common header.

   To provide identity protection it is RECOMMENDED that DTLS in SCTP is
   used with certificate-based authentication in DTLS 1.3 [RFC9147] and
   to not reuse tickets.  DTLS 1.3 with external PSK authentication does
   not provide identity protection.

   By mandating ephemeral key exchange and cipher suites with
   confidentiality DTLS in SCTP effectively mitigate many forms of
   passive pervasive monitoring.  By recommending implementations to
   frequently set up new DTLS connections with (EC)DHE force attackers
   to do dynamic key exfiltration and limits the amount of compromised
   data due to key compromise.

9.  IANA Consideration

   This document requests the following registration.

9.1.  SCTP Protection Solution Identifier

   IANA is requested to assign one SCTP Protoection Solution Indicator
   to identify the key-management defined in this document.

    +============+========================+===========+===============+
    | Identifier | Solution Name          | Reference | Contact       |
    +============+========================+===========+===============+
    |       4096 | DTLS in SCTP Handshake | RFC-TBD   | Draft Authors |
    +------------+------------------------+-----------+---------------+

                Table 1: SCTP Protection Solution Indicators

9.2.  TLS Exporter Labels

   IANA is requested to register the following values in the TLS
   Exporter Label Registry [RFC5705].  The registery was at the time of
   writing located at: https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/
   tls-parameters.xhtml#exporter-labels

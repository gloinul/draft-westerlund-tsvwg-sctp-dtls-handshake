     Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) in the Stream Control
                Transmission Protocol (SCTP) DTLS Chunk
           draft-westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-handshake-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a usage of Datagram Transport Layer Security
   (DTLS) 1.3 to protect the content of Stream Control Transmission
   Protocol (SCTP) packets using the framework provided by the SCTP DTLS
   chunk which we name DTLS in SCTP.  DTLS in SCTP provides encryption,
   source authentication, integrity and replay protection for the SCTP
   association with in-band DTLS based key-management and mutual
   authentication of the peers.  The specification is enabling very
   long-lived sessions of weeks and months and supports mutual re-
   authentication and rekeying with ephemeral key exchange.  This is
   intended as an alternative to using DTLS/SCTP (RFC6083) and SCTP-AUTH
   (RFC4895).

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   This document describes the usage of the Datagram Transport Layer
   Security (DTLS) protocol, as defined in DTLS 1.3 [RFC9147], in the
   Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), as defined in [RFC9260]
   with SCTP DTLS chunk [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].  This
   specification is intended as an alternative to DTLS/SCTP [RFC6083]
   and usage of SCTP-AUTH [RFC4895].

   This specification provides mutual authentication of endpoints, data
   confidentiality, data origin authentication, data integrity
   protection, and data replay protection of SCTP packets.  Ensuring
   these security services to the application and its upper layer
   protocol over SCTP.  Thus, it allows client/server applications to
   communicate in a way that is designed with communications privacy and
   preventing eavesdropping and detect tampering or message forgery.

   Applications using DTLS in SCTP can use all currently existing
   transport features provided by SCTP and its extensions, in some cases
   with some limitations, as specified in
   [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].  DTLS in SCTP supports:

   *  preservation of message boundaries.

   *  no limitation on number of unidirectional and bidirectional
      streams.

   *  ordered and unordered delivery of SCTP user messages.

   *  the partial reliability extension as defined in [RFC3758].

   *  multi-homing of the SCTP association per [RFC9260].

   *  the dynamic address reconfiguration extension as defined in
      [RFC5061].

   *  User messages of any size.

   *  SCTP Packets with a protected set of chunks up to a size of 2^14
      (16384) bytes.

1.2.  Protocol Overview

   DTLS in SCTP is a key management specification for the SCTP DTLS 1.3
   chunk [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk] that together utilizes
   all parts of DTLS 1.3 for the security functions like key exchange,
   authentication, encryption, integrity protection, and replay
   protection.  All key management message exchange happens inband over
   the SCTP assocation.

   In this document we use the terms DTLS Key context for indicating a
   Key, derived from a DTLS connection, and all relevant data that needs
   to be provided to the Protection Operator for DTLS encryption and
   decryption.  DTLS Key context includes Keys for sending and
   receiving, replay window, last used sequence number.  Each DTLS key
   context are associated with a four value tuple identifying the
   context, consisting of SCTP Association, the restart indicator, the
   DTLS Connection ID (if used), an the DTLS epoch.

   The basic functionalities and how things are related is described
   below.

   In a SCTP association where DTLS 1.3 Chunk usage has been negotiated
   in the SCTP INIT and INIT-ACK, to initilize and authenticate the peer
   the DTLS handshake is exchanged as SCTP user messages with the DTLS
   Chunk Key-Management Messages PPID (see section 10.6 of
   [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk]) until an initial DTLS
   connection has been established.  If the DTLS handshake fails, the
   SCTP association is aborted.  With succesful handshake and
   authentication of the peer the key material is configured for the
   DTLS 1.3 chunk.  From that point until SCTP association termination
   the DTLS chunk will protect the SCTP packets.  When the DTLS
   connection has been established and the DTLS Chunk configured with
   DTLS Key context the PVALID chunk is exchanged to verify that no
   downgrade attack between any offered protection solutions has
   occurred.  To prevent manipulation, the PVALID chunks are sent
   encapsulated in DTLS chunks.

   Assuming that the PVALID validation is successful the SCTP
   association is established and the Upper Layer Protocol (ULP) can
   start sending data over the SCTP association.  From this point all
   chunks will be protected by encapsulating them in DTLS chunks as
   defined in [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].  The DTLS chunk
   protects all of the SCTP Chunks to be sent in a SCTP packet.  Using
   the current DTLS Key context the DTLS Protection operator protects
   the plain text producing a DTLS Record that is encapsualted in the
   DTLS chunk and the transmitted as a SCTP packet with a common header.

   In the receiving SCTP endpoint each incoming SCTP packet on any of
   its interfaces and ports are matched to the SCTP association based on
   ports and VTAG in the common header.  Using the current DTLS Key
   context the content of the DTLS chunk is attempted to be processed,
   including replay protection, decryption, and integrity checking.  And
   if decryption and integrity verification was successful the produced
   plain text of one or more SCTP chunks are provided for normal SCTP
   processing in the identified SCTP association along with associated
   per-packet meta data such as path received on, original packet size,
   and ECN bits.

   When mutual re-authentication or rekeying with ephemeral key exchange
   is needed or desired by either endpoint a new DTLS connection
   handshake is performed between the SCTP endpoints and a new DTLS Key
   context is created.  When the handshake has completed the DTLS in
   SCTP implementation can simply switch to use the new DTLS Key context
   in the DTLS chunk.  After a short while (no longer than 2 min) to
   enable any outstanding packets to drain from the network path between
   the endpoints the old DTLS Key context can be deleted from the DTLS
   chunk's key store.

   The DTLS connection is free to send any alert, handshake message, or
   other non-application data to its peer at any point in time.  Thus,
   enabling DTLS 1.3 Key Updates for example.  All DTLS message will be
   sent by means of SCTP user messages with the DTLS Chunk Key-
   Management Messages PPID as specified in
   [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].

1.3.  Properties of DTLS in SCTP

   DTLS in SCTP (as the combination of the DTLS chunk and the in-band
   authentication and key-management using DTLS handshakes defined in
   this document) has a number of properties that are attractive.

   *  Provides confidentiality, integrity protection, and source
      authentication for each SCTP packet.

   *  Provides replay protection on SCTP packet level preventing
      malicious replay attacks on SCTP, both protecting the data as well
      as the SCTP functions themselves.

   *  Provides mutual authentication of the endpoints based on any
      authentication mechanism supported by DTLS.

   *  Uses parallel DTLS connections to enable mutual re-authentication
      and rekeying with ephemeral key-exchange.  Thus, enabling SCTP
      association lifetimes without known limitations and without
      needing to drain the SCTP association.

   *  Uses core of DTLS as it is and updates and fixes to DTLS security
      properties can be implemented without further changes to this
      specification.

   *  Secures all SCTP packets exchanged after SCTP association has
      reached the established state and the initial key-exchange has
      completed.  Making targeted attacks against the SCTP protocol and
      implementation much harder.

   *  DTLS in SCTP results in no limitations on user message
      transmission or message sizes, those properties are the same as
      for an unprotected SCTP association.

   *  Limited overhead on a per packet basis, with 4 bytes for the DTLS
      chunk plus the DTLS record overhead.  The DTLS overhead is
      dependent on the DTLS version and cipher suit.

   *  Support of SCTP packet plain text payload sizes up to 2^14 bytes.

1.3.1.  Benefits Compared to DTLS/SCTP

   DTLS/SCTP as defined by [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-dtls-over-sctp-bis] has
   several important differences most to the benefit of DTLS in SCTP.
   This section reviews these differences.

   *  Replay Protection in DTLS/SCTP has some limitations due to SCTP-
      AUTH [RFC4895] and its interaction with the SCTP implementation
      and dependencies on the actual SCTP-AUTH rekeying frequency.  DTLS
      in SCTP relies on DTLS mechanism for replay protection that can
      prevent both duplicates from being delivered as well as preventing
      packets from outside the current window to be delivered.  Thus, a
      stronger protection especially for non-DATA chunk is provided and
      protects the SCTP stack from replayed or duplicated packets.

   *  Encryption in DTLS/SCTP is only applied to ULP data.  For DTLS in
      SCTP all chunk types after the association has reached established
      state and the initial DTLS handshake has compeleted will be
      encrypted.  This, makes protocol attacks harder as a third-party
      attacker will have less insight into SCTP protocol state.  Also,
      protocol header information likes PPIDs will also be encrypted,
      which makes targeted attacks harder but may also make management
      and debugging harder.

   *  DTLS/SCTP Rekeying is complicated and require advanced API or user
      message tracking to determine when a key is no longer needed so
      that it can be discarded.  A DTLS/SCTP key that is prematurely
      discarded can result in loss of parts of a user message and
      failure of the assumptions on the transport where the sender
      believes it delivered and the receiver never gets it.  This
      usually will result in the need to terminate the SCTP association
      to restart the ULP session to avoid any issues due to
      inconsistencies.  DTLS in SCTP is robustly handling of any early
      discard of the DTLS Key context after having switched to a new
      established DTLS Key context.  Any outstanding packet that has not
      been decoded yet will simply be treated as lost between the SCTP
      endpoints, and SCTP's retransmission will retransmit any user
      message data that requires it.  Also, the algorithm for when to
      discard a DTLS connection can be much simpler.

   *  DTLS/SCTP rekeying can put restrictions on user message sizes
      unless the right APIs exist to the SCTP implementation to
      determine the state of user messages.  No such restriction exists
      in DTLS in SCTP.

   *  By using the DTLS chunk that is acting on SCTP packet level
      instead of user messages the consideration for extensions are
      quite different.  Only extensions that would affect the common
      header or how packets are formed would interact with this
      mechanism, any extension that just defines new chunks or
      parameters for existing chunks is expected to just work and be
      secured by the mechanism.  DTLS/SCTP instead interact with
      extensions that affects how user messages are handled.

   *  A known limitation is that DTLS in SCTP does not support more than
      2^14 bytes of chunks per SCTP packet.  If the DTLS implementation
      does not support the full DTLS record size the maximum supported
      packet size might be even lower.  However, this value needs to be
      compared to the supported MTU of IP, and are thus in reality often
      not an actual limitation.  Only for some special deployments or
      over loopback may this limitation be visible.  Also if the
      proposed extension to (D)TLS record sizes
      [I-D.mattsson-tls-super-jumbo-record-limit] are published and
      implemented this extension could be used to achieve full IP MTU
      (64k).

   There are several significant differences in regard to implementation
   between the two realizations.

   *  DTLS in SCTP do require the DTLS chunk to be implemented in the
      SCTP stack implementation, and not as an adaptation layer above
      the SCTP stack which DTLS/SCTP instead requires.  This has some
      extra challenges for operating system level implementations.
      However, as some updates anyway will be required to support the
      updated SCTP-AUTH specficiation the implementation burden is
      likely similar in this regard.

   *  DTLS in SCTP implemented in operating system kernels will require
      that the DTLS implementation is split.  Where the protection
      operations performed to create DTLS records needs to be
      implemented in the kernel and have an appropriate API for setting
      DTLS Key context and managed the functions of the protection
      operation.  While the DTLS handshake is residing as an application
      on top of SCTP interface.

   *  DTLS in SCTP can use a DTLS implementation that does not rely on
      features from outside of the core protocol, where DTLS/SCTP
      required a number of features as listed below:

      -  DTLS Connection Index to identify which DTLS connection that
         should process the DTLS record.

      -  Support for DTLS records of the maximum size of 16 KB.

      -  Optional to support negotiation of maximum DTLS record size
         unless not supporting 16 KB records when it is required.  Even
         if implementing the negotiation, interoperability failure may
         occur.  DTLS in SCTP will only require supporting DTLS record
         sizes that matches the largest IP packet size that endpoint
         support or the SCTP implementation.

      -  Implementation is required to support turning off the DTLS
         replay protection.

      -  Implementation is required to not use DTLS Key-update
         functionality.  Where DTLS in SCTP is agnostic to its usage,
         and it provides a useful tool to ensure that the key lifetime
         is not an issue.

   The conclusion of these implementation details is that DTLS in SCTP
   can use existing DTLS implementations, at least for user land SCTP
   implementation.  It is not known if any DTLS 1.3 stack exist that
   fully support the requirements of DTLS/SCTP.  It is expected that a
   DTLS/SCTP implementation will have to also extend some DTLS
   implementation.

2.  DTLS usage of DTLS Chunk

   DTLS in SCTP uses the DTLS chunk as specified in
   [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].  The chunk if just repeated
   here for the reader's convience.

    0                   1                   2                   3

   R: 1 bit (boolean)  Restart indicator.  If this bit is set this DTLS
      chunk is protected with an restart DTLS Key context.  If not set,
      then a traffic DTLS Key context is indicated.

   Payload: variable length  One DTLS record.

3.  DTLS messages over SCTP User Messages

   DTLS messages that are not DTLS records containing protected SCTP
   chunk payloads will be sent as SCTP user messages using the format
   defined below.  A DTLS handshake message may be fragmented by DTLS to
   a set of DTLS records of a maximum configured fragment size.  Each
   DTLS message fragment is sent as a SCTP user message on the same
   stream where each message is configured for reliable and in-order
   delivery with the PPID set to DTLS Chunk Key-Management Messages
   [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].  These user messages MAY
   contain one or more DTLS records.  The SCTP stream ID used MAY be any
   stream ID that the ULP alreay uses, and if not know Stream 0.  Note
   that all fragments of a handshake message MUST be sent with the same
   stream ID to ensure the in-order delivery.

   DTLS Message: variable length  One or more DTLS records.  In cases
      more than one DTLS record is included all DTLS records except the
      last MUST include a length field.  Note that this matches what is
      specified in DTLS 1.3 [RFC9147] will always include the length
      field in each record.

4.  DTLS Chunk Integration

   The [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk] contains a high-level
   description of the basic DTLS in SCTP architecture, this section
   deals with details related to the DTLS 1.3 inband key-establishment
   integration with SCTP.

4.1.  State Machine

   DTLS in SCTP uses inband key-establishment, thus the DTLS handshake
   establishes shared keys with the remote peer.  As soon as the SCTP
   State Machine enters PROTECTION INITILIZATION state, DTLS in SCTP is
   responsible for progressing to the PROTECTED state when DTLS
   handshake has completed.

4.1.1.  PROTECTION INITILIZATION state

   When entering PROTECTION INITILIZATION state, DTLS will start the
   handshake according to Section 6.2.

   When a successful handshake has been completed, the Traffic DTLS Key
   Context and the Restart DTLS Key Context will be created by deriving
   the keys from the DTLS connection.  At that point the DTLS chunk
   Handler will move to the VALIDATION state and perform validation and
   then move SCTP State Machine into PROTECTED state.

4.1.2.  PROTECTED state

   In the PROTECTED state the currently active DTLS connection is used
   for protection operation of the payload of SCTP chunks in each packet
   per below specification.  When necessary to meet requirements on
   periodic re-authentication of the peer and establishment of new
   forward secrecy keys, the existing DTLS 1.3 connection is being
   replaced with a new one by first opening a new parallel DTLS
   connection as further specified in Section 7 and then close the old
   DTLS connection.

4.1.3.  SHUTDOWN states

   When the SCTP association leaves the ESTABLISHED state per [RFC9260]
   to be shutdown the DTLS connection is kept and continues to protect
   the SCTP packet payloads through the shutdown process.

   When the association reaches the CLOSED state as part of the SCTP
   association closing process all DTLS connections existing (traffic
   and restart) for this association are terminated without further
   transmissions, i.e. DTLS close_notify is not transmitted.

4.2.  DTLS Connection Handling

   It's up to DTLS key-establishment function to manage the DTLS
   connections and their related DTLS Key Context in the DTLS chunk.

4.2.1.  Add a New DTLS Connection

   Either peer can add a new DTLS connection to the SCTP association at
   any time, but no more than 2 DTLS connections can exist at the same
   time.  Details of the handshake are described in Section 6.2.

   As either endpoint can initiate a DTLS handshake at the same time,
   either endpoint may receive a DTLS ClientHello message when it has
   sent its own ClientHello.  In this case the ClientHello from the
   endpoint that had the DTLS Client role in the establishment of the
   previous DTLS connection shall be continued to be processed and the
   other dropped.

   When the handshake has been completed successfully, the new DTLS
   connection will be possible to use, if the handshake is not completed
   successfully, a next DTLS handshake attempt will be tried.

4.2.2.  Remove an existing DTLS Connection

   A DTLS connection is removed when a newer DTLS connection is in use.
   It is RECOMMENDED to not initiate removal until at least one SCTP
   packet protected by the new DTLS Key Context has been received, and
   any transmitted packets protected using the new DTLS Key Context has
   been acknowledge, alternatively one Maximum Segment Lifetime (120
   seconds) has passed since the last SCTP packet protected by the old
   DTLS connection was transmitted.

   Either peers can initialize the removal of a DTLS connection from the
   current SCTP association when needed when a new have been
   established.  The closing of the DTLS connection when the SCTP
   association is in PROTECTED and ESTABLISHED state is done by having
   the DTLS connection send a DTLS close_notify.  When DTLS closure for
   a DTLS connection is completed, the related DTLS Key Context in the
   DTLS chunk are released.

4.2.3.  Considerations about removal of DTLS Connections

   Removal of a DTLS connection may happen under circumstances as
   described above in Section 4.2.2 in different states of the
   Association.  This section describes how the implementation should
   take care of the DTLS connection removal in details.

   The initial DTLS connection exists as soon as Association reaches the
   PROTECTED state.  As long as one DTLS connection only exists, that
   DTLS connection SHALL NOT be removed as it won't be possible for the
   Association to proceed further.

   In general a DTLS connection can be removed when there's at least
   another active DTLS connection with valid DTLS Key Context that can
   be used for negotiating further DTLS DTLS 1.3 connections.  In case
   the DTLS connection is removed and no useable DTLS Key Context exist
   for DTLS 1.3 negotiation, the Association SHALL be ABORTED.

   It is up to the implementation to guarantee that aDTLS Key Context
   exists at any time, for avoiding that undesired DTLS connection
   closure causes the Association abortion.

4.3.  DTLS Key Update

   DTLS Key Update MUST NOT be used.  DTLS Key Context replacemente MUST
   be used instead, by means creating a new DTLS connection as specified
   in Section 7, deriving the new Traffic DTLS Key Context, the new
   Restart DTLS Key Context and then closing the old DTLS connection.

4.4.  Error Cases

   As DTLS has its own error reporting mechanism by exchanging DTLS
   alert messages no new DTLS related cause codes are defined to use the
   error handling defined in [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].

   When DTLS encounters an error it may report that issue using DTLS
   alert message to its peer by putting the created DTLS record in a
   SCTP user message (Section 3).  This is independent of what to do in
   relation to the SCTP association.  Depending on the severance of the
   error different paths can be the result:

   Non-critical:  the DTLS connection can continue to protect the SCTP
      association.  In this case the issue may be worth reporting to the
      peer using a DTLS alert message, but otherwise continue without
      further action.

   Critical, but not immediately fatal:  If the DTLS connection has a
      critical issue, but can still protect packets then a the endpoint
      SHOULD attempt to establish a new DTLS connection.  If that
      succeeds then the SCTP association switches over to the new DTLS
      connection replace the DTLS Key Contextes, and can terminate the
      old DTLS connection including reporting the error.  In case the
      establishment fails, then this critical issue MUST be reported to
      the SCTP association so that it can send an ABORT chunk with the
      Error in Protection cause code.  This will terminate the SCTP
      association immediately, provide ULP with notification of the
      failure and speeding up any higher layer management of the
      failure.

   Critical, and immediately fatal:  If the DTLS connection fails so
      that no further data can be protected (i.e. either sent or
      received) with maintained security then it is not possible to
      establish a new DTLS connection and DTLS will have to indicate
      this to the SCTP implementation so it can perform a one sides SCTP
      association termination.  This will lead to an eventual SCTP
      association timeout in the peer.

5.  DTLS Considerations

5.1.  Version of DTLS

   This document defines the usage of DTLS 1.3 [RFC9147].  Earlier
   versions of DTLS MUST NOT be used (see [RFC8996]).  It is expected
   that DTLS in SCTP as described in this document will work with future
   versions of DTLS.

   Only one version of DTLS MUST be used during the lifetime of an SCTP
   Association, meaning that the procedure for replacing the DTLS
   version in use requires the existing SCTP Association to be
   terminated and a new SCTP Association with the desired DTLS version
   to be instantiated.

5.2.  Configuration of DTLS

5.2.1.  General

   The DTLS Connection ID SHOULD NOT be included in the DTLS records as
   it is not needed, avoiding overhead and addition implementation
   requirements on DTLS implementation.

   The DTLS record length field is normally not needed as the DTLS Chunk
   provides a length field unless multiple records are put in same DTLS
   chunk payload or user message.  If multiple DTLS records are included
   in one DTLS chunk payload or user message the DTLS record length
   field MUST be present in all but the last.

   DTLS record replay detection MUST be used.

   Sequence number size can be adapted based on how quickly it wraps.

   Many of the TLS registries have a "Recommended" column.  Parameters
   not marked as "Y" are NOT RECOMMENDED to support.  Non-AEAD cipher
   suites or cipher suites without confidentiality MUST NOT be
   supported.  Cipher suites and parameters that do not provide
   ephemeral key-exchange MUST NOT be supported.

5.2.2.  Authentication and Policy Decisions

   DTLS in SCTP MUST be mutually authenticated.  Authentication is the
   process of establishing the identity of a user or system and
   verifying that the identity is valid.  DTLS only provides proof of
   possession of a key.  DTLS in SCTP MUST perform identity
   authentication.  It is RECOMMENDED that DTLS in SCTP is used with
   certificate-based authentication.  When certificates are used the
   application using DTLS in SCTP is responsible for certificate
   policies, certificate chain validation, and identity authentication
   (HTTPS does for example match the hostname with a subjectAltName of
   type dNSName).  The application using DTLS in SCTP defines what the
   identity is and how it is encoded and the client and server MUST use
   the same identity format.  Guidance on server certificate validation
   can be found in [I-D.ietf-uta-rfc6125bis].  DTLS in SCTP enables
   periodic transfer of mutual revocation information (OSCP stapling)
   every time a new parallel connection is set up.  All security
   decisions MUST be based on the peer's authenticated identity, not on
   its transport layer identity.

   It is possible to authenticate DTLS endpoints based on IP addresses
   in certificates.  SCTP associations can use multiple IP addresses per
   SCTP endpoint.  Therefore, it is possible that DTLS records will be
   sent from a different source IP address or to a different destination
   IP address than that originally authenticated.  This is not a problem
   provided that no security decisions are made based on the source or
   destination IP addresses.

5.2.3.  New Connections

   Implementations MUST set up a new DTLS connection using a full
   handshake before any of the certificates expire.  It is RECOMMENDED
   that all negotiated and exchanged parameters are the same except for
   the timestamps in the certificates.  Clients and servers MUST NOT
   accept a change of identity during the setup of a new connections,
   but MAY accept negotiation of stronger algorithms and security
   parameters, which might be motivated by new attacks.

   Allowing new connections can enable denial-of-service attacks.  The
   endpoints MUST limit the number of simultaneous connections to two.

   To force attackers to do dynamic key exfiltration and limit the
   amount of compromised data due to key compromise, implementations
   MUST have policies for how often to set up new connections with
   ephemeral key exchange such as ECDHE.  Implementations SHOULD set up
   new connections frequently to force attackers to dynamic key
   extraction.  E.g., at least every hour and every 100 GB of data which
   is a common policy for IPsec [ANSSI-DAT-NT-003].  See
   [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis] for a more detailed discussion on key
   compromise and key exfiltration in (D)TLS.  As recommended in
   [KTH-NCSA], resumption can be used to chain the connections,
   increasing security by forcing an adversary to break them in
   sequence.

   For many DTLS in SCTP deployments the SCTP association is expected to
   have a very long lifetime of months or even years.  For associations
   with such long lifetimes there is a need to frequently re-
   authenticate both client and server by setting up a new connection
   using a full handshake.  TLS Certificate lifetimes significantly
   shorter than a year are common which is shorter than many expected
   SCTP associations protected by DTLS in SCTP.

5.2.4.  Padding of DTLS Records

   Both SCTP and DTLS contains mechanisms to padd SCTP payloads, and
   DTLS records respectively.  If padding of SCTP packets are desired to
   hide actual message sizes it RECOMMEDED to use the SCTP Padding
   Chunck [RFC4820] to generate a consistent SCTP payload size.  Support
   of this chunk is only required on the sender side.  However, if the
   PAD chunk is not supported DTLS padding MAY be used.

   It needs to be noted that independent if SCTP padding or DTLS padding
   is used the padding is not taken into account by the SCTP congestion
   control.  Extensive use of padding has potential for worsen
   congestion situations as the SCTP association will consume more
   bandwidth than its derived share by the congestion control.

   The use of SCTP PAD chunk is recommened as it at least can enable
   future extension or SCTP implementation that account also for the
   padding.  Use of DTLS padding hides this packet expansion from SCTP.

5.2.5.  DTLS 1.3

   DTLS 1.3 is used instead of DTLS 1.2 being a newer protocol that
   addresses known vulnerabilities and only defines strong algorithms
   without known major weaknesses at the time of publication.

   DTLS 1.3 requires rekeying before algorithm specific AEAD limits have
   been reached.  Implementations MAY setup a new DTLS connection
   instead of using key-update, this document mandates the setup of a
   new DTLS connection.

   In DTLS 1.3 any number of tickets can be issued in a connection and
   the tickets can be used for resumption as long as they are valid,
   which is up to seven days.  The nodes in a resumed connection have
   the same roles (client or server) as in the connection where the
   ticket was issued.  Resumption can have significant latency benefits
   for quickly restarting a broken DTLS/SCTP association.  If tickets
   and resumption are used it is enough to issue a single ticket per
   connection.

   The PSK key exchange mode : psk_ke MUST NOT be used as it does not
   provide ephemeral key exchange.

6.  Establishing DTLS in SCTP

   This section specifies how DTLS in SCTP is established
   [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].

   A DTLS in SCTP Association is built up with a DTLS connection, from
   that connection Traffic DTLS Key Context and Restart DTLS Key Context
   are derived.

   The DTLS connection is established as part of extra procedures for
   the DTLS chunk initial handshake (see Section 6.2.1).

6.1.  DTLS Key Context derivation

   This section describes how DTLS Key Contect are derived from the DTLS
   handshake.

6.2.  DTLS Handshake

6.2.1.  Handshake of initial DTLS connection

   The handshake of the initial DTLS connection is part of the DTLS in
   SCTP Association initialization.  The initialization is split in
   three distinct phases:

   *  SCTP Handshake

   *  DTLS Handshake

   *  Validation

   Moving towards next phase is possible only when the previous phase
   handshake is completed.

   SCTP Handshake is strictly compliant to [RFC9260].

   As soon the SCTP Association has entered the SCTP state PROTECTION
   INITILIZATION as defined by [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk]
   the DTLS handshake procedure is initiated by the endpoint that has
   initiated the SCTP association.

   The DTLS endpoint will send the DTLS message in one or more SCTP user
   message depending if the DTLS endpoint fragments the message or not
   Section 3.  The DTLS instance SHOULD NOT use DTLS retransmission to
   repair any packet losses of handshake message fragment.  Note: If the
   DTLS implementation supports configuring a MTU larger than the actual
   IP MTU it MAY be used as SCTP provides reliability and fragmentation.

   If the DTLS handshake is successful in establishing a security
   context to protect further communication and the peer identity is
   accepted then Traffic DTLS Key Context and Restart DTLS Key Context
   as specified in Section 6.1.

   The DTLS Key Contextes are installed for the DTLS chunk.  This then
   triggers validated of the association establishment (see Section 1.2)
   by handshaking PVALID messages.

   Once the Association has been validated, then the SCTP association is
   informed that it can move to the PROTECTED state.

   If the DTLS handshake failed the SCTP association SHALL be aborted
   and an ERROR chunk with the Error in Protection error cause, with the
   appropriate extra error causes is generated, the right selection of
   "Error During Protection Handshake" or "Timeout During Protection
   Handshake or Validation".

    Initiator                                     Responder

               Figure 4: Handshake of initial DTLS connection

   The Figure 4 shows a successfull handshake and highlits the different
   parts of the setup.  DTLS handshake messages are transported by means
   of DATA Chunks with the DTLS Chunk Key-Management Messages PPID.

6.2.2.  Handshake of further DTLS connections

   When the SCTP Association has entered the PROTECTED state, each of
   the endpoint can initiate a DTLS handshake for rekeying when
   necessary.

   The DTLS endpoint will if necessary fragment the handshake into
   multiple records.  Each DTLS handshake message fragment is sent as a
   SCTP user message Section 3.  The DTLS instance SHOULD NOT use DTLS
   retransmission to repair any packet losses of handshake message
   fragment.  Note: If the DTLS implementation support configuring a MTU
   larger than the actual IP MTU it could be used as SCTP provides
   reliability and fragmentation.

   If the DTLS handshake failed the SCTP association SHALL generate an
   ERROR chunk with the Error in Protection error cause, with extra
   error causes "Error During Protection Handshake".

          Initiator                                     Responder

              |                                             |

               Figure 5: Handshake of further DTLS connection

   The Figure 5 shows a successfull handshake of a further DTLS
   connection.  Such connections can be initiated by any of the peers.
   Same as during the initial handshake, DTLS handshake messages are
   transported by means of DATA chunks with the DTLS Chunk Key-
   Management Messages PPID.

6.3.  SCTP Association Restart

   In order to achieve an Association Restart as described in
   [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk], a Restart DTLS Key Context
   dedicated to Restart SHALL exist and be available.  Furthermore, both
   peers SHALL have safely stored both the current Restart DTLS Key
   Context.  Here we assume that Restart DTLS Key Context is maintained
   across the events leading to SCTP Restart request.

6.3.1.  Installation of initial Restart DTLS Key Context

   As soon as the Association has reached the PROTECTED INITILIZATION
   state, a Restart DTLS Key Context SHALL be installed.

   It MAY exist a time gap where the Association is in PROTECTED state
   but no Restart DTLS Key Context has been installed yet.  If a SCTP
   Restart procedure will be initiated during that time, it will fail
   and the Association will also fail.

   Once installed, no traffic will be sent over the Restart DTLS Key
   Context so that both endpoints will have a known DTLS record state.

6.3.2.  SCTP Association Restart Procedure

   The DTLS in SCTP Association Restart is meant to preserve the
   security characteristics.

   In order the Association Restart to proceed both Initiator and
   Responder SHALL use the same Restart DTLS Key Context for COOKIE-
   ECHO/COOKIE-ACK handshake, that implies that the Initiator must
   preserve the Restart DTLS Key Context and that the Responder SHALL
   NOT change the Restart DTLS Key Context during the Restart procedure.

           Figure 6: SCTP Restart sequence for DTLS in SCTP

   The Figure 6 shows a successfull SCTP Association Restart.

   From procedure viewpoint the sequence is the following:

   *  Initiator sends INIT (VTag=0), Responder replies INIT-ACK both
      encrypted using Restart DTLS Key Context

   *  Initiator sends COOKIE-ECHO using DTLS CHUNK encrypted with the
      Key tied to the Restart DTLS Key Context

   *  Responder replies with COOKIE-ACK using DTLS CHUNK encrypted with
      the to the Restart DTLS Key Context

   *  Initiator sends handshakes for new Traffic DTLS connnection as
      well as new Restart DTLS connection.

   *  When the handshake for the a new traffic DTLS connection has been
      completed, new Traffic and Restart DTLS Key Contextes are derived.
      New Traffic DTLS Key Context is being used for traffic.

   User Data for any ULP traffic MAY be initiated immediately after
   COOKIE-ECHO/COOKIE-ACK handshake using the current Restart DTLS Key
   Context, that is even before a new Traffic DTLS Key Context or a
   Restart DTLS Key Context have been derived.  If a problem occurs
   before the new Restart DTLS Key Context has been installed, the
   Association cannot be Restarted, thus it's RECOMMENDED the new
   Restart DTLS Key Context to be installed as early as possible.

   Note that, different than the initial Association establishment, the
   ULP traffic is permitted immediately after the COOKIE-ECHO/COOKIE-ACK
   handshake, the reason is that the validation has already been
   performed prior to the restart DTLS Key Context was created.

7.  Parallel DTLS Rekeying

   Rekeying in this specification is implemented by replacing the DTLS
   connection getting old with a new one by first creating the new DTLS
   connection, start using it, then closing the old one.

7.1.  Criteria for Rekeying

   The criteria for rekeying may vary depending on the ULP requirement
   on security properties, chosen cipher suits etc.  Therefore it is
   assumed that the implementation will be configurable by the ULP to
   meet its demand.

   Likely criteria to impact the need for rekeying through the usage of
   new DTLS connection are:

   *  Maximum time since last authentication of the peer

   *  Amount of data transferred since last forward secrecy preserving
      rekeying

   *  The cipher suit's maximum key usage being reached.  Although for
      DTLS 1.3 usage of the Key Update mechanism can generate new keys
      not having the same security properties as opening a new DTLS
      connection.

7.2.  Procedure for Rekeying

   This specification allows up to 2 DTLS connection to be active at the
   same time for the current SCTP Association.  The following state
   machine applies.

           +---------+
+--------->|  YOUNG  |  There's only one
|          +----+----+  DTLS connection until
|               |       aging criteria are met
|               |
|        AGING  |  REMOTE AGING
|               V
|          +---------+
|          |  AGED   |  When in AGED state a
|          +----+----+  new DTLS connection
|               |       is added with a newly derived Traffic DTLS Key Context
|      NEW DTLS |       As well as a new Restart DTLS Key Context
|               |
|               |
|               V
|          +---------+
|          |   OLD   |  In OLD state there
|          +----+----+  are 2 active DTLS connections
|               |       Traffic is switched to the new Traffic DTLS Key Context
|      SWITCH   |
|               V
|          +---------+
|          |  DRAIN  |  The aged DTLS connection
|          +----+----+  is drained before being ready
|               |       to be closed
|               |
|       DRAINED | DTLS close_notify
|               V
|          +---------+
|          |  DEAD   |  In DEAD state the aged
|          +----+----+  connection is closed
|               |
|      REMOVED  |
+---------------+

                 Figure 7: State Diagram for Rekeying

   Trigger for rekeying can either be a local AGING event, triggered by
   the DTLS connection meeting the criteria for rekeying, or a REMOTE
   AGING event, triggered by receiving a DTLS record on the Traffic
   Traffic DTLS Key Context that would be used for new DTLS connection.
   In such case a new DTLS connection shall be added according to
   Section 4.2.1 with a new Traffic DTLS Key Context.

   As soon as the new DTLS connection completes handshaking, and the
   Traffic and Restart DTLS Key Contextes have been derived, the traffic
   is moved from the old Traffic DTLS Key Context, then the procedure
   for closing the old DTLS connection is initiated, see Section 4.2.2.

7.3.  Race Condition in Rekeying

   A race condition may happen when both peer experience local AGING
   event at the same time and start creation of a new DTLS connection.

   The race condition is solved as specified in Section 4.2.1.

8.  PMTU Discovery Considerations

   Due to the DTLS record limitation for application data SCTP MUST use
   2^14 as input to determine absolute maximum MTU when running PMTUD
   and using DTLS in SCTP.

   The implementor needs to handle the DTLS 1.3 record overhead.  SCTP
   PMTUD needs to include both the DTLS record as well as the DTLS chunk
   overhead in this consideration and ensure that produced packets,
   especially those that are not PMTUD probes do not become oversized.
   The DTLS record size may change during the SCTP associations lifetime
   due to future handshakes affecting cipher suit in use, or changes to
   record layer configurations.

   Note that this implies that DTLS 1.3 is expected to accept
   application data payloads of potentially larger sizes than what it
   configured to use for messages the DTLS implementation generates
   itself for signaling.

9.  Implementation Considerations

   For each DTLS connection, there are certain crypto state infomration
   that needs to be handled thread safe to avoid nonce re-use and
   correct replay protection.  This arises as the key materials for DTLS
   epoch=3 and higher are shared between the DTLS chunk and the DTLS
   handshake parts.

   This issue is primarily for kernel implementation of SCTP, thus the
   DTLS chunk implementation resides in kernel space, and the DTLS
   handshake resides in user space.  For user space implementations
   where both DTLS handshake messages and SCTP message protection can
   directly call the same DTLS implementation instance the issue is
   avoided.

   Different implementation strategies do exists for the kernel
   implementations but likely have some impact on the DTLS
   implementation itself as the DTLS record protection processing either
   need to synchronize over state variables, alternatively use the DTLS
   Chunk protection operation using an extended DTLS Chunk API
   [I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].

10.  Security Considerations

10.1.  General

   The security considerations given in [RFC9147], [RFC6347], and
   [RFC9260] also apply to this document.  BCP 195 [RFC9325] [RFC8996]
   provides recommendations and requirements for improving the security
   of deployed services that use DTLS.  BCP 195 MUST be followed which
   implies that DTLS 1.0 SHALL NOT be supported and are therefore not
   defined.

10.2.  Privacy Considerations

   Although DTLS in SCTP provides privacy for the actual user message as
   well as almost all chunks, some fields are not confidentiality
   protected.  In addition to the DTLS record header, the SCTP common
   header and the DTLS chunk header are not confidentiality protected.
   An attacker can correlate DTLS connections over the same SCTP
   association using the SCTP common header.

   To provide identity protection it is RECOMMENDED that DTLS in SCTP is
   used with certificate-based authentication in DTLS 1.3 [RFC9147] and
   to not reuse tickets.  DTLS 1.3 with external PSK authentication does
   not provide identity protection.

   By mandating ephemeral key exchange and cipher suites with
   confidentiality DTLS in SCTP effectively mitigate many forms of
   passive pervasive monitoring.  By recommending implementations to
   frequently set up new DTLS connections with (EC)DHE force attackers
   to do dynamic key exfiltration and limits the amount of compromised
   data due to key compromise.

11.  IANA Consideration

   This document has no IANA considerations currently.

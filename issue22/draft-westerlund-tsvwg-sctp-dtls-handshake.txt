  Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) based key-management of the
         Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) DTLS Chunk
           draft-westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-handshake-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a key-management solution based on Datagram
   Transport Layer Security 1.3 (DTLS) to protect the content of Stream
   Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) packets using the packet
   protection framework provided by the SCTP DTLS chunk.  The
   combination provides encryption, source authentication, integrity and
   replay protection for the SCTP association with in-band DTLS based
   key-management and mutual authentication of the peers.  The
   specification is enabling very long-lived sessions of weeks and
   months and supports mutual re-authentication and rekeying with
   ephemeral key exchange.  The key-management solution does not require
   any additional defined features or implementation support beyond core
   DTLS 1.3.  This is intended as a replacement to using DTLS/SCTP
   (RFC6083) and SCTP-AUTH (RFC4895).

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Overview

   This document describes the usage of the Datagram Transport Layer
   Security version 1.3 (DTLS) [RFC9147] protocol for key-management of
   the SCTP DTLS Chunk packet protection
   [I-D.draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk] securing Stream Control
   Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC9260].  This combination of
   specifications is intended as a replacement to DTLS/SCTP [RFC6083]
   and usage of SCTP-AUTH [RFC4895].  The combination of SCTP DTLS Chunk
   and the key-management defined in this document we refer to as DTLS
   in SCTP.

   DTLS in SCTP provides mutual authentication of endpoints, data
   confidentiality, data origin authentication, data integrity
   protection, and data replay protection of SCTP packets.  Ensuring
   these security services to the application and its upper layer
   protocol over SCTP.  Thus, it allows client/server applications to
   communicate in a way that is designed with communications privacy and
   preventing eavesdropping and detect tampering or message forgery.

   Applications using DTLS in SCTP can use all currently existing
   transport features provided by SCTP and its extensions, in some cases
   with some limitations, as specified in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].  DTLS in SCTP supports:

   *  preservation of message boundaries.

   *  no limitation on number of unidirectional and bidirectional
      streams.

   *  ordered and unordered delivery of SCTP user messages.

   *  the partial reliability extension as defined in [RFC3758].

   *  multi-homing of the SCTP association per [RFC9260].

   *  the dynamic address reconfiguration extension as defined in
      [RFC5061] (Limitations apply).

   *  User messages of any size.

   *  SCTP Packets with a protected set of chunks up to a size of 2^14
      (16384) bytes.

   The main benefit of this key-management solution over the solution
   proposed by the WG is that this does not require any extensions to
   DTLS 1.3 to be implemented.  It solely relies on the core DTLS
   handshake to do mutual authentication, creates a main secret, and
   then relies on the TLS exporter to export necessary secrets for the
   DTLS Chunk.

1.2.  Protocol Overview

   DTLS in SCTP is a key management specification for the SCTP DTLS 1.3
   chunk [I-D.draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk] that together utilizes
   DTLS 1.3 for the security functions like key exchange,
   authentication, encryption, integrity protection, and replay
   protection.  All key management message exchange happens inband over
   the SCTP assocation.

   In this document we use the terms DTLS Key context for indicating the
   pair of keys, derived from a DTLS connection, and all relevant data
   that needs to be provided to the SCTP DTLS Chunk Protection Operator
   for DTLS encryption and decryption.  DTLS Key context includes Keys
   for sending and receiving, replay window, and last used sequence
   number.  Each DTLS key context is associated with a four value tuple
   identifying the context, consisting of SCTP Association, the restart
   indicator, the DTLS Connection ID (if used), and the DTLS epoch.

   The basic functionalities and how things are related is described
   below:

   *  The process starts with a SCTP association where DTLS 1.3 Chunk
      usage has been negotiated and this key-management method has been
      agreed in the SCTP INIT and INIT-ACK.  To initialize and
      authenticate the peer the DTLS handshake is exchanged as SCTP user
      messages with the DTLS Chunk Key-Management Messages PPID (see
      section 10.6 of [I-D.draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk]) until an
      initial DTLS connection has been established.  If the DTLS
      handshake fails, the SCTP association is aborted.  With successful
      handshake and authentication of the peer the key material is
      exported from the DTLS connection and configured for the DTLS 1.3
      chunk.  From that point until SCTP association termination the
      DTLS chunk will protect the SCTP packets.  When the DTLS
      connection has been established and the DTLS Chunk configured with
      DTLS Key context the PVALID message is sent to trigger the peer
      SCTP Endpoint that Protection initiation has been completed.

   *  After PVALID is received, the Upper Layer Protocol(ULP) can start
      sending messages over the SCTP association.  All chunks are
      protected by encapsulating them in DTLS chunks as defined in
      [I-D.draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].  Using the current DTLS
      Key context the DTLS Chunk Protection operator protects the plain
      text, which is all chunks to be sent in one SCTP packet, producing
      a DTLS Record that is encapsulated in the DTLS chunk and then
      transmitted as a SCTP packet with a common header.

   The DTLS Chunk specifies that in the receiving SCTP endpoint each
   incoming SCTP packet on any of its interfaces and ports are matched
   to the SCTP association based on ports and VTAG in the common header.
   Using the indicated DTLS Key context(s) for that SCTP association the
   content of the DTLS chunk is attempted to be processed, including
   replay protection, decryption, and integrity checking.  If decryption
   and integrity verification was successful the produced plain text of
   one or more SCTP chunks are provided for normal SCTP processing in
   the identified SCTP association along with associated per-packet meta
   data such as path received on, original packet size, and ECN bits.

   When mutual re-authentication or rekeying is needed or desired by
   either endpoint a new DTLS connection handshake is performed between
   the SCTP endpoints and new DTLS Key contexts are created.  When the
   handshake is completed, the DTLS in SCTP implementation can simply
   switch to use the new DTLS Key contexts in the DTLS chunk.  All
   rekeying SHALL be using ephemeral key exchange and SHALL NOT use the
   DTLS Key-Update mechanism to avoid confusion about the properties of
   the DTLS Key Contexts for the DTLS chunk.  After a short while (no
   longer than 2 min) to enable any outstanding packets to drain from
   the network path between the endpoints, the old key-management DTLS
   connection is closed and that signal that the corresponding key
   context can be deleted from the DTLS chunk's key store.

   The DTLS connection may send alerts, handshake messages, or other
   non-application data to its peer at any point in time.  All DTLS
   message will be sent by means of SCTP user messages with the DTLS
   Chunk Key-Management Messages PPID as specified in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].  However, only the DTLS
   close_notify is expected to be used after the handshake has been
   completed in this solution.

1.3.  Properties of DTLS in SCTP

   DTLS in SCTP (as the combination of the DTLS chunk and the in-band
   authentication and key-management using DTLS handshakes defined in
   this document) has a number of properties that are attractive.

   *  Provides confidentiality, integrity protection, and source
      authentication for each SCTP packet.

   *  Provides replay protection on SCTP packet level preventing
      malicious replay attacks on SCTP, both protecting the data as well
      as the SCTP functions themselves.

   *  Provides mutual authentication of the endpoints based on any
      authentication mechanism supported by DTLS.

   *  Uses parallel DTLS connections to enable mutual re-authentication
      and rekeying with ephemeral key-exchange.  Thus, enabling SCTP
      association lifetimes without known limitations and without
      needing to drain the SCTP association.

   *  Uses core of DTLS as it is and updates and fixes to DTLS security
      properties; can be implemented without further changes to this
      specification.

   *  No reliance on DTLS implementation used for key-management having
      to support any features beyond core DTLS specification and the TLS
      exporter.

   *  Secures all SCTP packets exchanged after SCTP association has
      reached the established state and the initial key-exchange has
      completed.  Making targeted attacks against the SCTP protocol and
      implementation much harder.

   *  DTLS in SCTP results in no limitations on user message
      transmission or message sizes, those properties are the same as
      for an unprotected SCTP association.

   *  Limited overhead on a per packet basis, with 4 bytes for the DTLS
      chunk plus the DTLS record overhead.  The DTLS overhead is
      dependent on the DTLS version and cipher suit.

   *  Support of SCTP packet plain text payload sizes up to 2^14 bytes.

1.4.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms:

   Association:  An SCTP association.

   Connection:  A DTLS connection.

   DTLS Key context:  Keys, derived from a DTLS connection, and all
      relevant data that needs to be provided to the SCTP DTLS Chunk.
      Each DTLS key context is associated with a four value tuple
      identifying the context, consisting of SCTP Association, the
      restart indicator, the DTLS Connection ID (if used), and the DTLS
      epoch

   Primary DTLS Key context:  A DTLS Key context used to protect the
      regular SCTP traffic, i.e. not a restart DTLS Key context.

   Restart DTLS Key context:  A DTLS Key context to be used for an SCTP
      Association Restart

   Stream:  A unidirectional stream of an SCTP association.  It is
      uniquely identified by a stream identifier.

   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  DTLS usage of DTLS Chunk

   DTLS in SCTP uses the DTLS chunk as specified in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].  The chunk if just repeated
   here for the reader's convenience.

    0                   1                   2                   3

                       Figure 2: DTLS Chunk Structure

   Type: 8 bits  The Chunk Type indicate that this is the DTLS chunk.

   reserved: 7 bits  Reserved bits for future use.  Sender MUST set
      these bits to 0 and MUST be ignored on reception.

   R: 1 bit (boolean)  Restart indicator.  If this bit is set this DTLS
      chunk is protected with by a Restart DTLS Key context.

   Chunk Length: 16 bits (unsigned integer)  This value holds the length
      of the Payload in bytes plus 4.

   Payload: variable length  This holds the encrypted data as one DTLS
      1.3 Record [RFC9147].

   Padding: 0, 8, 16, or 24 bits  To ensure the Chunk is whole 32-bit
      words long.

3.  DTLS messages over SCTP User Messages

   When DTLS in SCTP has completed the initialization, that is after
   PVALID message has been sent for triggering, DTLS messages for the
   Handshake DTLS connection, i.e. that are not DTLS records containing
   protected SCTP chunk payloads, will be sent as SCTP user messages
   using the format defined in Figure 3.  A DTLS handshake message may
   be fragmented by DTLS to a set of DTLS records of a maximum
   configured fragment size.  Each DTLS message fragment is sent as a
   SCTP user message on the same stream where each message is configured
   for reliable and in-order delivery with the PPID set to DTLS Chunk
   Key-Management Messages [I-D.draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].
   These user messages MAY contain one or more DTLS records.  The SCTP
   stream ID used MAY be any stream ID that the ULP already uses, and if
   not known Stream 0.  Note that all fragments of a handshake message
   MUST be sent with the same stream ID to ensure the in-order delivery.

   The DTLS instance SHOULD NOT use DTLS retransmission to repair any
   packet losses of handshake message fragment.  If the DTLS
   implementation supports configuring a MTU larger than the actual IP
   MTU it MAY be used as SCTP provides reliability and fragmentation.

                   Figure 3: DTLS User Message Structure

   Reserved: 6 bits  Each bit MUST be set to zero (0) on transmission
      and MUST be ignored on reception.  These bits MAY in the future be
      assigned a meaning when set to one (1).

   DCI: DTLS Connection Index 2 bits (unsigned integer)  DTLS Connection
      Index is the lower two bits of an DTLS Connection Index counter
      which corresponds to the epoch used in the SCTP DTLS Chunk.  This
      is a counter implemented in DTLS in SCTP that is used to identify
      which DTLS connection instance that is capable of processing the
      DTLS message over a user message.  This index is recommended to be
      the lower part of a 64-bit unsigned integer variable as this is
      how DTLS epoch counter is defined.  DCI is unrelated to the DTLS
      Connection ID [RFC9147].  The counters initial value SHALL be
      three (3).

   DTLS Message: variable length  One or more DTLS records.  In cases
      more than one DTLS record is included all DTLS records except the
      last MUST include a length field.  Note that this matches what is
      specified in DTLS 1.3 [RFC9147] will always include the length
      field in each record.

4.  Protection Valid Message

   The Protection Valid message is sent from the Responder to the
   Initiator when the Responder has confirmed reception of DTLS chunk
   protected DTLS messages.  This message triggers requiring protection
   at the Initiator when it has been received.  Once received from the
   Initiator, the Protection Valid Message is relayed back to the
   Responder.  At reception of the message the Responder will be enabled
   at sending Traffic.

   The message SHALL be sent protected.

   The message is 2 bytes and is 0x4F4B.  This SCTP user message MUST be
   sent reliably on Stream 0 with in order delivery in relation to any
   DTLS ACK message.

5.  DTLS Chunk Integration

   The [I-D.draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk] contains a high-level
   description of the basic DTLS in SCTP architecture, this section
   deals with details related to the DTLS 1.3 inband key-management
   integration with SCTP.

5.1.  SCTP Association Life Cycle.

   DTLS in SCTP uses inband key-management, thus the DTLS handshake for
   a Key-Management DTLS Connection establishes a new DTLS Connection
   with the remote peer from which both peers will derive DTLS Key
   Contexts.  As soon as the SCTP State Machine enters ESTABLISHED
   state, DTLS in SCTP is responsible for progressing to where the DTLS
   Chunk is fully configured and the ULP will be protected.

5.1.1.  Protection Initialization

   When the SCTP Association enter ESTABLISHED state, the initiator will
   start the handshake according to Section 7.2.

   When a successful handshake has been completed, the Primary DTLS Key
   Context and the Restart DTLS Key Context will be created by deriving
   the keys and IVs from the key-management DTLS connection.  These will
   be installed in the Chunks Protection Operator as defined in this
   document to avoid dead lock, ensure successful protection and
   enabling the ULP traffic.

5.1.2.  SCTP Association Ongoing

   When an SCTP Association is protected the established Primary DTLS
   key context is used for Chunk protection operation of the payload of
   SCTP chunks in each packet per the DTLS Chunk specification
   [I-D.draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].

   When necessary to meet requirements on key life time or periodic re-
   authentication of the peer and establishment of new forward secrecy
   keys, the existing DTLS 1.3 key-managment connection is being
   replaced with a new one by first opening a new parallel DTLS
   connection as further specified in Section 8, derive and install new
   DTLS Key Contexts and then close the old DTLS connection and remove
   the old DTLS Key contexts.

5.1.3.  SHUTDOWN states

   When the SCTP association leaves the ESTABLISHED state per [RFC9260]
   to be shutdown the DTLS Chunk's key contexts are kept and continue to
   protect the SCTP packet payloads through the shutdown process.

   When the association reaches the CLOSED state as part of the SCTP
   association closing process, all DTLS connections existing for this
   association are terminated without further transmissions, i.e. DTLS
   close_notify is not transmitted.

5.2.  DTLS Connection Handling

   It's up to DTLS key-management function to manage the DTLS
   connections and their related DTLS Key context in the Chunk
   Protection Operator.

5.2.1.  Add a New DTLS Connection

   Either peer can add a new DTLS connection to the SCTP association at
   any time, but no more than 2 DTLS connections can exist at the same
   time.  Details of the handshake are described in Section 7.2.2.

   As either endpoint can initiate a DTLS handshake at the same time,
   either endpoint may receive a DTLS ClientHello message when it has
   sent its own ClientHello.  In this case the ClientHello from the
   endpoint that had the DTLS Client role in the establishment of the
   previous DTLS connection shall be continued to be processed and the
   other dropped.

   When the handshake has been completed successfully, the new DTLS Key
   contexts are established by exporting keys and installing them in the
   Chunk Protection Operator, and the new DTLS Key context are
   immediately started to be used.  If the handshake is not completed
   successfully, a new DTLS handshake attempt will be tried using the
   same DCI.

5.2.2.  Remove an existing DTLS Connection

   A DTLS connection is removed when a newer DTLS connection is in use.
   It is RECOMMENDED to not initiate removal until at least one SCTP
   packet protected by the new DTLS Key Context has been received, and
   any transmitted packets protected using the new DTLS Key Context has
   been acknowledged, alternatively waiting for one Maximum Segment
   Lifetime (120 seconds) has elapsed since the last SCTP packet
   protected by the old DTLS connection was transmitted.

   Either peers can initiate the removal of a DTLS connection from the
   current SCTP association when needed when a new have been
   established.  The closing of the DTLS connection when the SCTP
   association is in PROTECTED and ESTABLISHED state is done by having
   the DTLS connection sending a DTLS close_notify.  When the DTLS
   closure of a DTLS connection is completed, the related DTLS Key
   Contexts (Primaryand Restart) in the Chunk Protection Operator are
   released.

5.2.3.  Considerations about removal of DTLS Connections

   Removal of a DTLS connection may happen under circumstances as
   described above in Section 5.2.2 in different states of the
   Association.  This section describes how the implementation should
   take care of the DTLS connection removal in details:

   *  As long as one DTLS connection only exists, that DTLS connection
      SHALL NOT be removed as it won't be possible for the Association
      to proceed further.

   *  A DTLS connection can be removed when there's another active DTLS
      connection with valid DTLS Key Contexts that can be used for
      negotiating further key-management DTLS 1.3 connections.

   *  In case the DTLS connection is removed and no useable DTLS Key
      Context exist for key-management DTLS 1.3 negotiation, the
      Association SHALL be ABORTED.

   It is up to the implementation to guarantee that a DTLS Key Context
   exists all the time, for avoiding that undesired DTLS connection
   closure causes the Association abortion.

5.3.  DTLS Key Update

   DTLS Key Update MUST NOT be used.  DTLS Key Context replacement MUST
   be used instead, by means of creating a new DTLS connection as
   specified in Section 8, deriving the new Primary DTLS Key Context,
   the new Restart DTLS Key Context and then closing the old DTLS
   connection.

5.4.  Error Cases

   As DTLS has its own error reporting mechanism by exchanging DTLS
   alert messages.  No new DTLS related cause codes are defined to use
   the error handling defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].

   When the handshake of DTLS connection encounters an error it may
   report that issue using DTLS alert message to its peer by putting the
   created DTLS record in a SCTP user message (see Section 3) with the
   Handshake PPID.  This is independent of what to do in relation to the
   SCTP association.  Depending on the severity of the error different
   decisions can be taken.

   However, as it is not expected that the key-management DTLS
   connection will have any activity at all between completing the
   handshake, and the DTLS connection closing, it is unlikely that any
   error will occur.

6.  DTLS Considerations

6.1.  Version of DTLS

   This document defines the usage of DTLS 1.3 [RFC9147].  Earlier
   versions of DTLS MUST NOT be used (see [RFC8996]).  It is expected
   that DTLS in SCTP as described in this document will work with future
   versions of DTLS.

   Only one version of DTLS MUST be used during the lifetime of an SCTP
   Association, meaning that the procedure for replacing the DTLS
   version in use requires the existing SCTP Association to be
   terminated and a new SCTP Association with the desired DTLS version
   to be instantiated.

6.2.  Configuration of Key-Management DTLS

6.2.1.  General

   The DTLS Connection ID SHOULD NOT be used in the Key-Management
   avoiding overhead and addition implementation requirements on DTLS
   implementation.

   The DTLS record length field is normally not needed as the DTLS Chunk
   provides a length field unless multiple records are put in same DTLS
   chunk payload or user message.  Note that bundling is NOT PERMITED
   and only one DTLS Chunk can be transmitted in a SCTP Packet.

   DTLS record replay detection MUST be used.

   Sequence number size can be adapted based on how quickly it wraps.

   Many of the TLS registries have a "Recommended" column.  Parameters
   not marked as "Y" are NOT RECOMMENDED to support.  Non-AEAD cipher
   suites or cipher suites without confidentiality MUST NOT be
   supported.  Cipher suites and parameters that do not provide
   ephemeral key-exchange MUST NOT be supported.

   The Cipher suites negotiated in the Key-Management DTLS Connection
   SHALL only include those supported by the DTLS Chunk.  The DTLS Chunk
   is expected to have an API capability to determine the Cipher Suit
   Capabilities, see Abstract API in Section 10 of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].

6.2.2.  Authentication and Policy Decisions

   DTLS in SCTP MUST be mutually authenticated.  Authentication is the
   process of establishing the identity of a user or system and
   verifying that the identity is valid.  DTLS only provides proof of
   possession of a key.  DTLS in SCTP MUST perform identity
   authentication.  It is RECOMMENDED that DTLS in SCTP is used with
   certificate-based authentication.

   When certificates are used the application using DTLS in SCTP is
   responsible for certificate policies, certificate chain validation,
   and identity authentication (HTTPS does for example match the
   hostname with a subjectAltName of type dNSName).  The application
   using DTLS in SCTP defines what the identity is and how it is encoded
   and the client and server MUST use the same identity format.
   Guidance on server certificate validation can be found in [RFC9525].
   DTLS in SCTP enables periodic transfer of mutual revocation
   information (OSCP stapling) every time a new parallel connection is
   set up.  All security decisions MUST be based on the peer's
   authenticated identity, not on its transport layer identity.

   It is possible to authenticate DTLS endpoints based on IP addresses
   in certificates.  SCTP associations can use multiple IP addresses per
   SCTP endpoint.  Therefore, it is possible that DTLS records will be
   sent from a different source IP address or to a different destination
   IP address than that originally authenticated.  This is not a problem
   provided that no security decisions are made based on the source or
   destination IP addresses.

6.2.3.  New Connections

   Implementations MUST set up a new DTLS connection using a full
   handshake before any of the certificates expire.  It is RECOMMENDED
   that all negotiated and exchanged parameters are the same except for
   the timestamps in the certificates.  Clients and servers MUST NOT
   accept a change of identity during the setup of a new connections,
   but MAY accept negotiation of stronger algorithms and security
   parameters, which might be motivated by new attacks.

   Allowing new connections can enable denial-of-service attacks.  The
   endpoints MUST limit the number of simultaneous connections to two.

   To force attackers to do dynamic key exfiltration and limit the
   amount of compromised data due to key compromise, implementations
   MUST have policies for how often to set up new connections with
   ephemeral key exchange such as ECDHE.  Implementations SHOULD set up
   new connections frequently to force attackers to dynamic key
   extraction.  E.g., at least every hour and every 100 GB of data which
   is a common policy for IPsec [ANSSI-DAT-NT-003].  See
   [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis] for a more detailed discussion on key
   compromise and key exfiltration in (D)TLS.  As recommended in
   [KTH-NCSA], resumption can be used to chain the connections,
   increasing security by forcing an adversary to break them in
   sequence.

   For many DTLS in SCTP deployments the SCTP association is expected to
   have a very long lifetime of months or even years.  For associations
   with such long lifetimes there is a need to frequently re-
   authenticate both client and server by setting up a new connection
   using a full handshake.  TLS Certificate lifetimes significantly
   shorter than a year are common which is shorter than many expected
   SCTP associations protected by DTLS in SCTP.

6.2.4.  DTLS 1.3

   DTLS 1.3 is used instead of DTLS 1.2 being a newer protocol that
   addresses known vulnerabilities and only defines strong algorithms
   without known major weaknesses at the time of publication.

   DTLS 1.3 requires rekeying before algorithm specific AEAD limits have
   been reached.  Implementations setup a new DTLS connection to handle
   the need for new keys, alternatively terminate the SCTP Assocation.

   In DTLS 1.3 any number of tickets can be issued in a connection and
   the tickets can be used for resumption as long as they are valid,
   which is up to seven days.  The nodes in a resumed connection have
   the same roles (client or server) as in the connection where the
   ticket was issued.  Resumption can have significant latency benefits
   for quickly restarting a broken DTLS/SCTP association.  If tickets
   and resumption are used it is enough to issue a single ticket per
   connection.

   The PSK key exchange mode : psk_ke MUST NOT be used as it does not
   provide ephemeral key exchange.

7.  Establishing DTLS in SCTP

   This section specifies how DTLS in SCTP is established using Key-
   Management DTLS Connections and the DTLS Chunk
   [I-D.draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk].

   A DTLS in SCTP Association is built up with a Key-Management DTLS
   connection, from that DTLS connection Primary DTLS Key Context and
   Restart DTLS Key Context are derived and the configures the DTLS
   Context.

   The Key-Management DTLS connection is established as part of extra
   procedures for the DTLS chunk initial handshake (see Section 7.2.1).

7.1.  DTLS Key Context derivation

   This section describes how DTLS Key Contexts are derived from the
   DTLS handshake using the TLS Exporter as defined by [RFC9147].  The
   TLS exporter label specifications below is following [RFC5705].

   There are two sets of keys one for the Primary DTLS key context and
   one for the Restart DTLS Key Context.  Each set consists of one
   client and one server side write key.  In addition each key needs an
   Initilization Vector (IV) that is used by the record processing in
   TLS to create the nonce, See Section 5.3 of [RFC8446].  The client
   and server roles are here in relation to key-management DTLS session
   roles.  So the DTLS Client will install the key derived using the
   EXPORTER_DTLS_IN_SCTP_PRIMARY_CLIENT_KEY label as its write key for
   the Primary DTLScontext, and use the
   EXPORTER_DTLS_IN_SCTP_PRIMARY_SERVER_KEY as its Primary DTLS context
   read key.  Correspondlingly the
   EXPORTER_DTLS_IN_SCTP_RESTART_CLIENT_KEY is used to export the key
   used by the endpoint that acted as DTLS Client as write key for the
   restart DTLS key context.  And the
   EXPORTER_DTLS_IN_SCTP_RESTART_SERVER_KEY as the DTLS client's read
   key for the restart DTLS Key Context.  Correspondligy the IV values
   needs to be exported using the corresponding _IV label.

   The following labels are defined:

   *  EXPORTER_DTLS_IN_SCTP_PRIMARY_CLIENT_KEY

   *  EXPORTER_DTLS_IN_SCTP_PRIMARY_CLIENT_IV

   *  EXPORTER_DTLS_IN_SCTP_PRIMARY_SERVER_KEY

   *  EXPORTER_DTLS_IN_SCTP_PRIMARY_SERVER_IV

   *  EXPORTER_DTLS_IN_SCTP_RESTART_CLIENT_KEY

   *  EXPORTER_DTLS_IN_SCTP_RESTART_CLIENT_IV

   *  EXPORTER_DTLS_IN_SCTP_RESTART_SERVER_KEY

   *  EXPORTER_DTLS_IN_SCTP_RESTART_SERVER_IV

   To ensure that downgrade attack on the protection solution offered is
   not possible the context used will be the full sequence of Protection
   Solution Identifiers as include in the DTLS 1.3 Chunk Protected
   Association (Section 4.1 of [I-D.draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk])
   sent by the SCTP assocation initiator.  Thus, any downgrade attack on
   this will result in a mismatch in produced keys as the initiator will
   use what it actually offered and the responder a truncated or
   modified sequence.

   The length of the exported key or IV material depends on the need for
   the negotiatated cipher suit for the protection.

7.2.  DTLS Handshake

7.2.1.  Protection Initilization using DTLS connection

   The handshake of the initial DTLS connection is part of the DTLS in
   SCTP Association initialization.  The key-management DTLS connections
   progress interacts with the key installation for the SCTP
   associations DTLS chunk.

               Figure 4: Handshake of initial DTLS connection

   SCTP Handshake is strictly compliant to [RFC9260].  The DTLS 1.3
   Chunk Protected Association parameter (Section 4.1 of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk]) is included containing the
   Protection Solution identifier (See Section 10.1) for this documents
   key-management at a suitable preference position depending on local
   policy.  And in case this key-management solution is the most
   preferred then the process continues as stated below and depiceted in
   Figure 5.

     Figure 5: The steps of Interaction between Key-Management and
                             DTLS Chunk API

   1.   The Initiator initiates an SCTP Association and provides the
        DTLS 1.3 Chunk Protected Association parameter preference
        ordered list of supporter Protection Solutions.  The offered
        parameter list is remembered by the Key-Management.

   2.   The Responder peer enter SCTP Established, and the Key-
        Management is provided with the full ordered list of Protection
        Solutions offered in the INIT Chunk.

   3.   The Initiator enters SCTP Assocationa Established and the Key-
        Management is triggered to perform the next step.

   4.   Key-Management initiated a DTLS handshake with the the supported
        configuration.  Taking supported Cipher-suits in the DTLS Chunk
        implementation into account when creating its DTLS Client-Hello
        mesage.  The DTLS messages are sent per Section 3

   5.   Responder receives DTLS Client-Hello and generates the DTLS
        Server Hello, etc response message(s) for the DTLS handshake.
        In case the DTLS server in the responder requires the use of the
        retry message an additional message exchange between DTLS Client
        and DTLS server is needed before one can progress to 5.

   6.   Responder uses its the TLS Exporter on the DTLS Connection's
        state to derive the primary client write key and IV Section 7.1
        and install them into the Chunk Protection Operator's Primary
        Key Context.  Then it sends the DTLS Server's response
        message(s).

   7.   The DTLS client receives the DTLS server's messages (Server
        Hello etc.) and can now export both the client and server write
        key for the Primary and Restart Key Contexts, however their
        usage is not yet required and SCTP packets without DTLS chunks
        are still accepted.  Then the DTLS Client next handshake message
        is sent.  This message SHALL be protected by the DTLS Chunk
        using the Primary key Context (Client Write key and IV).

   8.   The responder's Chunk Protection Operator will receive the SCTP
        packets containing the DTLS chunk protected DTLS messages,
        concluding the main process of the DTLS handshake.

   9.   The responder exports the remaining keys and IVs and installs
        all Primary and Restart Server Write Key and IV, as well as
        restart client write key and IV.  After that it requires all
        future SCTP Packets to be protected by DTLS Chunk.  If any DTLS
        ACK message is to be sent, it SHOULD be sent next.  Then it
        sends a protected Protection Valid Message Section 4 to the SCTP
        Association Initiators Key-Management.

   10.  Having received the Protection Valid Message, the initiator's
        key-management can now inform the ULP that the SCTP association
        is protected and verified.  It shall also send a Protection
        Validation Message to the responder.  Upon successful reception
        of the Protection Valid Message the Initiator's Key-Management
        configure the DTLS Chunk to only accept DTLS Chunk Protected
        SCTP packets.  Upon successful reception of the Protection Valid
        Message the Responder's Key-Management informs the SCTP stack
        that the Association is Validated and traffic can be sent.

   11.  The Initiator's ULP is notified that the SCTP association is
        Established and protected and it may generate user messages.

   If the DTLS handshake fails the SCTP association SHALL be aborted and
   an ERROR chunk with the Error in Protection error cause, with the
   appropriate extra error causes is generated, the right selection of
   "Error During Protection Handshake" or "Timeout During Protection
   Handshake or Validation".

7.2.2.  Handshake of further DTLS connections

   When the SCTP Association has entered the PROTECTED state, each of
   the endpoint can initiate a DTLS handshake for Key-Management when
   necessary.

   The DTLS Key-Management will act as a User of SCTP, identified with
   the Key-Management PPID 4242.  DTLS handshake is sent as a SCTP user
   message according to Section 3.

   The DTLS instance SHOULD NOT use DTLS retransmission to repair any
   packet losses of handshake message fragment.  If the DTLS
   implementation support configuring a MTU larger than the actual IP
   MTU it could be used as SCTP provides reliability and fragmentation.

   If the DTLS handshake fails the SCTP association SHALL generate an
   ERROR chunk with the Error in Protection error cause, with extra
   error causes "Error During Protection Handshake".

     Initiator                                               Responder
         |                                                       |

         +<------------[DTLS CHUNK(DATA(DTLS ACK))]--------------+
         |                                                       |

               Figure 6: Handshake of further DTLS connection

   The Figure 6 shows a successful handshake of a further DTLS
   connection.  Such connections can be initiated by any of the peers.
   Here DTLS handshake messages are transported by means of DATA chunks
   with the DTLS Chunk Key-Management Messages PPID inside DTLS Chunks.

7.3.  SCTP Association Restart

   In order to achieve an Association Restart as described in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk], a Restart DTLS Key Context
   dedicated to Restart SHALL exist and be available.  Furthermore, both
   peers SHALL have safely stored both the current Restart DTLS Key
   Context.  Here we assume that Restart DTLS Key Context is maintained
   across the events leading to SCTP Restart request.

7.3.1.  Installation of initial Restart DTLS Key Context

   As soon as the Association has reached the ESTABLISHED state and
   before the Primary DTLS Key context have been installed a Restart
   DTLS Key Context SHALL be derived and then installed.

   It MAY exist a short time gap where the Association has already been
   validated state but no Restart DTLS Key Context has been installed
   yet.  If a SCTP Restart procedure will be initiated during that time,
   it will fail and the Association will also fail.  However, this is
   unlikely as the Restart Init will be sent multiple times following a
   exponential back-off timer and in that time the Restart DTLS Key
   Context is expected to be in place.

   Once installed, no traffic will be sent over the Restart DTLS Key
   Context so that both endpoints will have a known DTLS context state,
   i.e. the Sequence number and replay window are both just initialized
   to default values for the epoch=3.

7.3.2.  Installation of Restart DTLS Key Context for further DTLS
        Connections

   As each subsequent Key-Management DTLS connection completes the DTLS
   handshake and the Primary DTLS Key context has been derived and
   installed also the Restart DTLS Key context SHALL be installed.  The
   closing of the previous DTLS connection SHALL NOT be initiated or
   completed until the Restart DTLS Key Context is in place.

7.3.3.  SCTP Association Restart Procedure

   The DTLS in SCTP Association Restart is meant to preserve the
   security characteristics.

   In order the Association Restart to proceed both Initiator and
   Responder SHALL use the same Restart DTLS Key Context for COOKIE-
   ECHO/COOKIE-ACK handshake, that implies that the Initiator must
   preserve the Restart DTLS Key Context and that the Responder SHALL
   NOT change the Restart DTLS Key Context during the Restart procedure.

             Figure 7: SCTP Restart sequence for DTLS in SCTP

   The Figure 7 shows a successful SCTP Association Restart.

   From procedure viewpoint the sequence is the following:

   *  Initiator sends INIT (VTag=0), Responder replies INIT-ACK in Plain
      Text as specified in [RFC9260]

   *  Initiator sends COOKIE-ECHO using DTLS CHUNK encrypted with the
      Key tied to the Restart DTLS Key Context

   *  Responder replies with COOKIE-ACK using DTLS CHUNK encrypted with
      the Restart DTLS Key Context

   *  Initiator and Responder handshake a new DTLS connection

   *  The ULP can resume communication protected using the Restart DTLS
      Key Context.

   *  New Primary and Restart DTLS Key Context is derived and installed
      using Epoch=3.  The new Traffic DTLS Key Context is being used for
      traffic.  When Primary DTLS Key Context has been installed the new
      Restart DTLS Key Context for epoch=3 is installed.

   User Data for any ULP traffic MAY be initiated immediately after
   COOKIE-ECHO/COOKIE-ACK handshake using the current Restart DTLS Key
   Context, that is even before a new Primary DTLS Key Context or a
   Restart DTLS Key Context have been derived.  If a problem occurs
   before the new Restart DTLS Key Context has been installed, the
   Association cannot be Restarted, thus it's RECOMMENDED the new
   Restart DTLS Key Context to be installed as early as possible.

   Note that, different than the initial Association establishment, the
   ULP traffic is permitted immediately after the COOKIE-ECHO/COOKIE-ACK
   handshake, the reason is that the validation has already been
   performed prior to the restart DTLS Key Context was created.

8.  Parallel DTLS Rekeying

   Rekeying in this specification is implemented by replacing the DTLS
   connection getting old with a new one by first creating the new DTLS
   connection, derive the new DTLS Key contexts, start using them, then
   closing the old DTLS connection and revoking the old DTLS Key
   contexts.

8.1.  Criteria for Rekeying

   The criteria for rekeying may vary depending on the ULP requirement
   on security properties, chosen cipher suits etc.  Therefore it is
   assumed that the implementation will be configurable by the ULP to
   meet its demand.

   Likely criteria to impact the need for rekeying through the usage of
   new DTLS connection are:

   *  Time duration since last authentication of the peer

   *  Amount of data transferred since last forward secrecy preserving
      rekeying

   *  The cipher suit's maximum key usage being reached.

8.2.  Procedure for Rekeying

   This specification allows up to 2 DTLS connection to be active at the
   same time for the current SCTP Association.  The following state
   machine applies.

              +---------+
   +--------->|  YOUNG  |  There's only one
   |          +----+----+  DTLS connection until
   |               |       aging criteria are met
   |               |
   |        AGING  |  REMOTE AGING
   |               V
   |          +---------+
   |          |  AGED   |  When in AGED state a new DTLS connection is
   |          +----+----+  added and deriving new Primary DTLS Key
   |               |       Context as well as a new Restart DTLS Key
   |      NEW DTLS |       Context
   |               |
   |               |
   |               V
   |          +---------+
   |          |   OLD   |  In OLD state there are 2 active DTLS
   |          +----+----+  connections Traffic is switched to the new
   |               |       Primary DTLS Key Context
   |      SWITCH   |
   |               V
   |          +---------+
   |          |  DRAIN  |  The aged DTLS connection
   |          +----+----+  is drained before being ready
   |               |       to be closed
   |               |
   |       DRAINED | DTLS close_notify
   |               V
   |          +---------+
   |          |  DEAD   |  In DEAD state the aged
   |          +----+----+  connection is closed
   |               |
   |      REMOVED  |
   +---------------+

                    Figure 8: State Diagram for Rekeying

   Trigger for rekeying can either be a local AGING event, triggered by
   the DTLS connection meeting the criteria for rekeying, or a REMOTE
   AGING event, triggered by receiving a DTLS Connection handshake on
   the DTLS Connection Index (next value) that would be used for new
   DTLS connection.  In such case a new DTLS connection shall be added
   according to Section 5.2.1.

   As soon as the new DTLS connection completes handshaking, and the
   Primary and Restart DTLS Key Contexts have been derived and
   installed, the protection of the SCTP packets is moved from the old
   Primary DTLS Key Context, then the procedure for closing the old DTLS
   connection is initiated, see Section 5.2.2.

8.3.  Race Condition in Rekeying

   A race condition may happen when both peers experience local AGING
   event at the same time and start creation of a new DTLS connection.

   The race condition is solved as specified in Section 5.2.1.

9.  Security Considerations

9.1.  General

   The security considerations given in [RFC9147], [RFC6347], and
   [RFC9260] also apply to this document.  BCP 195 [RFC9325] [RFC8996]
   provides recommendations and requirements for improving the security
   of deployed services that use DTLS.  BCP 195 MUST be followed which
   implies that DTLS 1.0 SHALL NOT be supported and are therefore not
   defined.

9.2.  Privacy Considerations

   Although DTLS in SCTP provides privacy for the actual user message as
   well as almost all chunks, some fields are not confidentiality
   protected.  In addition to the DTLS record header, the SCTP common
   header and the DTLS chunk header are not confidentiality protected.
   An attacker can correlate DTLS connections over the same SCTP
   association using the SCTP common header.

   To provide identity protection it is RECOMMENDED that DTLS in SCTP is
   used with certificate-based authentication in DTLS 1.3 [RFC9147] and
   to not reuse tickets.  DTLS 1.3 with external PSK authentication does
   not provide identity protection.

   By mandating ephemeral key exchange and cipher suites with
   confidentiality DTLS in SCTP effectively mitigate many forms of
   passive pervasive monitoring.  By recommending implementations to
   frequently set up new DTLS connections with (EC)DHE force attackers
   to do dynamic key exfiltration and limits the amount of compromised
   data due to key compromise.

10.  IANA Consideration

   This document requests the following registration.

10.1.  SCTP Protection Solution Identifier

   IANA is requested to assign one SCTP Protection Solution Identifier
   to identify the key-management defined in this document.

    +============+========================+===========+===============+
    | Identifier | Solution Name          | Reference | Contact       |
    +============+========================+===========+===============+
    |       4096 | DTLS in SCTP Handshake | RFC-TBD   | Draft Authors |
    +------------+------------------------+-----------+---------------+

                Table 1: SCTP Protection Solution Indicators

10.2.  TLS Exporter Labels

   IANA is requested to register the following values in the TLS
   Exporter Label Registry [RFC5705] with Reference RFC-TO-BE and empty
   Comment.  The registry was at the time of writing located at:
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-
   parameters.xhtml#exporter-labels
